    "abstract": "In a world in which a family historian can type her grandfather's name into Ancestry.com to start building a family tree, and a journalist can Google to download public domain images, where do the collections searches, online tools, and APIs that museums and archives provide fit in? This paper outlines strategies for better serving people who are looking for the knowledge and expertise within your collections and staff. At the National Archives and Records Administration of the United States, we undertook a significant user experience (UX) research project to better understand the online experiences of professional researchers, family historians, and history enthusiasts. Research methods included audits of existing user data (e.g., Google Analytics, survey data) as well as new user interviews, usability testing, a survey, and a landscape analysis. Key findings include the fact that researchers struggle to complete their tasks using existing online tools; people researching family history are particularly unsatisfied and in need of better support; and all audiences require just-in-time help and appropriate orientation to archival research. A major challenge highlighted by this research is how to meet user expectations for item-level records while providing access to digitized records at massive scale."

    "abstract": "The Museum of Islamic Art (MIA) in Doha, Qatar is a landmark building in the city and the country. Located on its own island, the museum seems to float in the Arabian Gulf nestled between 'old' and 'new' Doha. Designed by renowned architect I.M. Pei, MIA is a popular destination for tourists and residents alike. With an Instagram following of more than 37 million users, the museum and its surrounding areas also prove to be a popular destination for photo opportunities. This paper presents the results of a 6-month study of more than 4,000 Instagram images, posted between November 2014 and November 2015, tagged to the Museum of Islamic Art's geolocation. Drawing on visual content analysis, the project reveals graphic trends in the visiting narrative, situating this experience not only within the museum's collection, but also within the social and cultural fabric of the country. The paper argues for a stronger emphasis to the role of visual media shared online, as a meaning-laden medium and embodied social practice that has the capacity to create preconceptions and expectations about museum visiting experiences. In addition, the potential of visual media is discussed as habitual products that fuel a virtuous circle of influence between individuals and communities through practices of collaboration and co-creation of information and narratives. Overall, the paper will offer an understanding of the potential of Instagram as a reflection of the cultural citizenship of the varied memory communities associated with the museum - online and offline."

    "url": "https://mw18.mwconf.org/paper/using-coyote-to-describe-the-world",
    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "In November of 2015, the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (MCA) launched a website with a rare accessibility feature. The website team had committed to making all of the images on the site accessible to the widest possible audience—particularly visitors with vision impairment—through visual description. To do so, the MCA worked with Sina Bahram and his team at Prime Access Consulting to develop a workflow tool, backing service, and API to support a distributed description workflow. The description project, Coyote, is an outstanding illustration of the principles of universal design, which argue that products designed to be useful to one community (in this case, people who are blind or have low vision) are likely to benefit a variety of users, not just those with disabilities. Invented to solve an unresolved need at the MCA and within the community, Coyote has in a short time expanded well beyond its original scope, bringing together a team of expert and poetic describers, passionate accessibility advocates, and open source developers and bringing needed attention to the ways that visual description might become a useful aspect of museum practice. In addition to discussing the policy, institutional, and technical implications around large-scale image description, (including both short and long descriptions), we also plan on presenting the latest enhancements, made possible by a museum technology grant from the Knight Foundation, to Coyote. These include a greatly enhanced representational model that can track visual descriptions of real world objects in addition to images, integration of concepts from the semantic web to facilitate rich search, the development of an organizational model that is used to offer a centralized Coyote instance to multiple institutions in a cloud-hosted version of the software, and enhancements to the Coyote API to facilitate broader third-party access such as Coyote being used for a treasure-hunt-like game based on visual descriptions."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "In July of 2017, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) published Soundtracks, its first online exhibition catalog and the museum's first digital publication since the launch of its redesigned website in 2015. SFMOMA has a rich history in digital publishing, from its early forays into interpretive multimedia, to the scholarly, collection-focused Rauschenberg Research Project (RRP) of 2013, born out of the Getty Foundation's Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI). Using the findings from the OSCI project as a point of departure, this presentation will examine SFMOMA's approach to the next generation of museum digital publications, including evaluation strategies, and how SFMOMA's organizational structure contributed to the project's implementation. Two case studies—\"Soundtracks\" and the forthcoming \"Focus on Japanese Photography\"—will demonstrate the benefits of flexible template design and its efficacy in delivering both special exhibition and permanent collection content. Special consideration will be given to time-based art and the possibilities afforded by an online publication model, as well as innovative approaches to documenting sound-based art using newly available technologies such as 360 video. A summary of the project's quantitative and qualitative evaluation will also be presented, including engagement with multimedia documentation and written content, user pathways through the publication, and user experience funnels to and from the rest of the site. This analysis will provide valuable data to inform content strategy best practices for the promotion and placement of digital scholarly content on museum websites. Lastly, this presentation will touch on the organizational structure of SFMOMA's Content Strategy and Digital Engagement division and how it enabled this work to be carried out. In this context, we will consider how institutional framework can influence innovation in digital publication production, maintenance, and sustainability."

    "url": "https://mw18.mwconf.org/paper/using-the-mean-stack-to-implement-an-easy-access-web-interface-to-provide-a-mobile-application-framework-for-museum-professionals",
    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "The idea of supporting a certain group of people in the Museum Application Domain by offering information systems is well established. In the past all considerations regarding information delivery were centered solely on the customer endpoint. From early audio guides, through video screens, to interactive information panels— that point of view has never changed. The content and interfaces have been directed towards the patron in an on-premise setting. The introduction of smart mobile devices has transformed societal perception permanently. The demand and the possibilities of offers today keep growing rapidly on a daily basis. The visitor is no longer limited to their role as a consumer, but becomes a co-creator of the museum experience. Therefore it is mandatory to engage museum professionals to adapt their strategies and implement those changes—especially members of small and medium sized institutions, who are often challenged by the speed of change and in dire need of support. This paper focuses on encapsulating concepts purposed to reduce the stress of taking the first steps towards technological advances in the Museum Application Domain. Mediating the socio-technical changes is pivotal, as well as to impart them to all members of an institution. Hence this paper is directed towards directors and leaders of small and medium-sized museums. It discusses the implications of a Mobile First approach as an entry point for adapting an overall digital strategy."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "With the rise of contactless payment technology, charities and cultural institutions are exploring new opportunities to raise funds from visitor donations. Coin donation boxes have long been accepted as part of the fabric of museum and gallery spaces, but are there easier ways to support institutions? Can digital technology create new types of giving experiences? Focussing on three key examples run at the National Museum of Scotland in 2017, this paper outlines the core challenges of creating donation experiences using contactless technology. It will examine the projects' failures and success, sharing key insights about visitor behavior and exploring how lessons can be applied across the sector as museums look to embrace new ways to generate in-venue support. Revealing both visitor feedback and the financial results of the trials, a range of key questions will be investigated: How does the positioning of the contactless terminal within the museum space affect the frequency of visitor donations? What types of experience and core messaging can best attract attention and prompt interaction? How does the use of contactless technology for donations differ from commercial transactions—and how can organizations build visitor confidence in new technology, facilitating new ways of giving? Although supported by one specific technical setup (using terminals supplied by the Dutch company Payter), other types of contactless setups will be considered alongside shifting patterns of consumer behavior and the supporting financial infrastructures across different countries. The trials by National Museums Scotland will also be placed in the context of the cultures of giving in the charity and GLAM sectors, asking how important contactless giving will become to museums and galleries under increasing financial pressure.  "

    "abstract": "Private collections provide engaging windows into little-known subjects that, when made discoverable, are incredibly relevant to many diverse audiences. The Texas Coastal Bend Collection (TCBC) is a digital-first private collection that offers rich insight into the culture of the Texas Coastal Bend ranching communities, starting with the Irish immigration in 1834. The site's topic-based framework immerses people in the region's cultural history. Rich, well-structured metadata (subjects, people, places, historic events, relationships) allows every page to be a gateway for exploring over 200 artistic photographs, 9,000 images, archival documents, books, maps, genealogies, and 1,400 hours of oral history. We describe the strategies and tools that enable rich exploration of the TCBC's unique resources, its maintenance by a small dedicated staff, and how meaningful digital connections with other institutions can foster storytelling across an array of subjects. The digital approach that underpins the TCBC, incorporating highly structured categorization, linked data, IIIF, and a unique audio player, provides insights that can be used by other museums and archives. This talk is valuable for people who manage historic and/or archival collections that aspire to be online, and institutions that plan to create shareable online digital resources that can be connected with other institutions' collections. It provides insights into ways that oral history and images can be used to assemble flexible topic-based narrative structures, and, it provides insight into technical and curatorial approaches, so others don't have to “start from scratch.”"

    "url": "https://mw18.mwconf.org/paper/building-a-smart-museum-tackling-in-gallery-challenges-with-digital-experience-at-scale",
    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in gallery spaces, not just for science museums/centers, but for museums and galleries of all types. Museums are thus experiencing a range of new, common challenges, requiring approaches that can scale, to ensure long term sustainability. Museum applications can draw on robust Web standards and platforms for presentation, accessibility, data, etc. However, museum installations frequently go beyond a traditional Web page oriented paradigm. In-gallery applications of digital technology can vary widely, and range far beyond the computer/touch screen. They may include digital/mechanical interactives, experiential and immersive environments, and \"headless\" (non-screen) or other non-traditional interfaces. The Canada Science and Technology Museum reopened in November of 2017, after a complete reconstruction and reconceptualization of the exhibition experience. This presented an opportunity to tackle a number of contemporary museum challenges with digital technologies head-on, drawing on lessons learned from many institutions. This paper will outline many of these contemporary challenges for in-gallery digital interactives, exploring a number of facets, including hardware and software management; content management; analytics; deficiency/issue management; accessibility standards; design standards; systems and data Integration; and certainly not least, people. For each of these facets, this session will draw on experiences from the renewed Canada Science and Technology Museum to illustrate how these challenges can be tackled, and will also contrast these with alternate approaches taken at other institutions. It highlights how an enterprise IoT approach can help tackle the challenge of managing digital experience at scale."

We have more channels and increasingly more data than we can manage.  We are drowning in data but unable to draw meaningful insights from that data.  This paper looks at the journey the American Museum of Natural History has taken to define and monitor the institutional digital and physical footprint. This allows us to extend beyond traditional measures of website traffic to understand the channel mix, shifts between channels over time, and understand initiatives that drive growth in overall reach. In addition, it is about understanding key behavioral characteristics of the audience. Rather than looking at audience behavior in a single channel, we are looking at behavior across the integrated physical and digital experience or journey. Also, to understand how visitors move across digital channels as well as between digital and physical channels (the museum).

Finally, it is focused on identifying insights that support decision-making rather than generating reporting. Leveraging this data to drive decision-making in the museum that delivers on the museum's goals and objectives, by confirming hypotheses about the audience."

    "url": "https://mw18.mwconf.org/paper/skill-and-sensibility-the-creative-producer",
    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Innovation. Immersion. Engagement. Does any twenty-first century art museum not state these terms boldly in their mission statement? Creative professionals occupying a broad range of specialized design roles within multimedia production teams and across inter-disciplinary design departments are faced with delivering upon this organizationally predetermined promise on a daily basis. However, is it reasonable to question what constitutes deeper, more meaningful in-gallery experiences in the context of the “visitor-centered” museum? And how do we produce them? In order to rise to this challenge, an enormous opportunity exists to push both technological innovation and our existing approaches to content creation by cultivating new models for media production that are studio lead, audience focused, and industry-engaged. In order to meet the increased reliance on digital content to achieve immersive exhibition experiences—including, but certainly not restricted to, virtual reality, creative museum professionals must draw upon a complex weave of industry skill and artistic sensibility in order to effectively design interpretive and aesthetic experiences in our galleries that are no longer just informative and meaningful, but imaginative, moving, and profound. This paper sets out to strategically position the role of the “creative producer” by redefining the boundaries of its cross-disciplinary functions; in doing so, it also raises questions of how museums support their own production of creative content. We will argue that the role is ideally suited to facilitate co-production between artist and audience, especially in response to the increasing onus placed on immersive design. So, what implications does immersive design hold for the Creative Producer?"

    "abstract": "Beyond a few articles and some statistical studies, and despite its importance to museum work, it can be argued that the issue of workforce diversity in museums has been overlooked. This article aims to investigate how workforce diversity can impact the innovation capabilities of museums as well as their relevance to the communities they serve. The lack of diversity in museums exceeds professional positions and extends to board members, constituents, and donors, who are usually described as overwhelmingly White, able-bodied, college-educated, and affluent. This research questions if some of the problems which museums face today, such as the lack of attendance, relevance and innovation are linked to the lack of diversity. Workplace diversity is a major factor in how the public perceives the institution, and accordingly chooses to interact, or not to interact, with it. This research uses aspects of the Museum Innovation Model (Eid, 2016) around social innovation, and draws upon some empirical studies in the museology and business studies literature on workplace diversity. For example, the definition and impact of two-dimensional diversity—which takes into consideration inherent and acquired factors—is explored. Additionally, this paper reviews some of the common strategies inside and outside the museum sector to increase workforce diversity, including training and internship programs, as well as affirmative action policies and guidelines. The paper concludes by acknowledging that museums with a diverse workforce are better positioned to innovate and engage more diverse communities. Workforce diversity ensures that there is a large pool of knowledge, skills, life experiences, perspectives, and expertise to help the institution face today's challenges more effectively and efficiently."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Learning takes place everywhere, throughout a lifetime—and museums are an important part of the informal learning ecosystem. But how do we make these learning experiences count? How can we convey to future schools and employers that lessons outside the classroom provide valuable skills? The concept of digital badging, being explored throughout the worlds of education and credentialing, seeks to answer these questions. Most people are familiar with the concept of badging from the scouting world, in which Boy Scouts' and Girl Scouts' physical patches match up with accomplishments, projects completed, and lessons learned. Digital badges are awarded online, but like scout badges, they represent a fun, moderately competitive way to track progress. Organizations like LRNG and the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub are developing online systems to formalize and support communities dedicated to digital badging. Badging programs have come and gone over the past few years, but examining the badging programs that have lasted and those that have not provide valuable lessons about what successful badging looks like. This paper looks at museums' past and current involvement with the emerging world of connected learning and digital badging, through the examples of San Diego's Art and Science of Vision and the Pittsburgh Galleries Project. It compares the models of these, and other digital badging projects, highlighting successes and challenges, and placing them in the larger context of current educational philosophy. Museums pride themselves on being public resources, with plentiful primary source materials and educational content. Museums are also in a constant search for relevance. By finding ways to incorporate into, and help advance digital badging, museums can take a more active role in shaping and supporting the future of education."

    "abstract": "The increasing use of digital technologies necessitates a reevaluation of professional norms in the cultural heritage sector. Digital technologies provide enticing opportunities to increase accessibility, maximize public standing, decrease costs, and preserve heritage in new, more affordable ways. Digital technologies also present precarious ethical challenges, defy existing definitions and professional values, and risk further commodification of cultural heritage. This paper provides an overview of the digital technologies impacting at-risk cultural heritage sites in Syria, and examines how they are used in the destruction, preservation, and reconstruction of those sites. By investigating current communication structures, surveying the use of geospatial imagery and geospatial data, and assessing technologically-assisted reconstruction efforts, we begin to understand how technology is impacting the destruction and reconstruction of tangible cultural heritage sites in Syria."

    "abstract": "The increasing use of digital technologies necessitates a reevaluation of professional norms in the cultural heritage sector. Digital technologies provide enticing opportunities to increase accessibility, maximize public standing, decrease costs, and preserve heritage in new, more affordable ways. Digital technologies also present precarious ethical challenges, defy existing definitions and professional values, and risk further commodification of cultural heritage. This paper provides an overview of the digital technologies impacting at-risk cultural heritage sites in Syria, and examines how they are used in the destruction, preservation, and reconstruction of those sites.

    "abstract": "In 2016, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) began development of the exhibition \"Rights of Passage.\" This exhibition explores human rights history in Canada over the 150 years since Confederation—how the rights and freedoms we now enjoy were fought for by those before us who refused to stay silent in the face of inequality and injustice, examining concepts and stories of courageous actions that inspire us to continue to work for the rights of all. The challenge undertaken with this exhibition was to immerse visitors within content in a way that encouraged relevance. Design direction focused on two primary tactics—medium and material— both creatively used to provoke visitor action, participation, and create relevance. Experience design through the \"Rights of Passage\" exhibition builds on CMHR's reputation of mixed media presentation, immersive and layered storytelling, and integrating physical artifact, text, and image within transmedia storytelling. Included in the presentation are traditional media interfaces such as a radio and television, gesture and audio activated experiences, culminating in augmented spaces that include user-contributed content, wearable technology, and 3D-virtual artifacts (holograms). The boundaries of progressive storytelling and education are expanded through this design, placing the visitor at the center of a shared experience that is both physical and virtual in nature. Exhibition design is increasingly under the obligation to create hybrid spaces that merge the real and the virtual. The opportunities and drawbacks of new technology are creating seismic changes in how museums balance storytelling, scholarship, collection of physical objects, digitization, and enabling visitor engagement in both physical and digital environments.

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Four and a half years ago, the Rijksmuseum launched the successful website Rijksmuseum.nl and the digital concept Rijksstudio, which became the cultural digital heritage benchmark for connecting people and the collection. Today, with over 325,000 works of art, 360,000 accounts, more than 2,000,000 free downloads, and 200,000 personal collections, Rijksstudio continues to grow. Over the past two years, we have witnessed an increasing shift in the market towards mobile. The Rijksmuseum is responding to this trend with a major redesign of Rijksstudio and the new Rijksmuseum app. After the redesign, Rijksstudio presents personal collections compiled by users, together with stories from the Rijksmuseum in the same simple and mobile-first visual template. And publishing them literally next to each other is our way of showing that we are OPEN online. The Rijksmuseum wants to seize the opportunities mobile has to offer with a new state-of-the-art app (launch January 2018). It consists of three main sections: 1. Rijksstudio 2. Multimedia tours 3. E-tickets With the new app, you can enjoy the Rijksmuseum collection wherever you are: in a train, at home on the couch, or in the museum taking a multimedia tour. The app offers one simple way of enjoying the collection for everyone, whenever, wherever. \"Swiping\" through the collection and personal Rijksstudio collections, and browsing through the museum itself, is a similar experience, since the museum's multimedia tours are fully integrated in the app. It is all one intuitive user art experience. An important part of the new app is the innovative indoor automatic wayfinding that is fully integrated with our multimedia tours. This platform uses an interactive map and tailor-made automatic wayfinding directions for the museum site. The app will always know where you are by means of 300 iBeacons that have been placed invisibly in the museum. With this new infrastructure, the app can guide you to and from any location."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Vernacular networked digital photographs shared through social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter have now, by far, replaced analog photographs and traditional photo albums. For museums and archives, the change of media implies that receiving physical vernacular photographic objects will soon be a thing of the past. The social media photograph is ephemeral and needs to be collected through an active effort, not long after the creation of the photograph. It is an assemblage of image, text, metadata, and affected by the digital network in which it is shared. This paper will discuss current findings and reflections of the ongoing research project titled \"Collecting Social Photo\" which is a cooperation between a number of museums, archives, and universities in the Nordic countries. Findings will be illustrated through case studies reflecting social photography from a personal perspective (Social Media Diaries), the production of the image of places (the city of Södertälje, Sweden and Aalborg, Denmark), and as the reaction to sudden events such as the Stockholm terrorist attack in 2017. As the visual representation of the social digital photograph is not sufficient to understand the challenges of the memory institutions when collecting and disseminating contemporary photographic heritage, the project includes studies of metadata and the material practices in which the photograph is produced. This paper will share insight into the complexity of the social digital photograph, which has been studied by (among others) Nancy Van House (2016), Edgar Gómez Cruz, and Asko Lehmuskallio (2016), and regard it from the perspective of memory institutions through the experience of case studies with a focus on audience engagement, work practices, and digital infrastructures for collecting social digital photography."

    "abstract": "Museums and cultural heritage organizations wrestle with ticketing systems, finding it hard to access the data, apply complex discounting, and maintain brand experience. In 2017, two organizations took on innovative approaches to solve some of these problems. The Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) developed a new ticketing site internally, a Web product called Museum Nice and Simple Ticketing (MNST). Its key concept: a cart-less and login-less experience. Also in 2017, the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia) launched a new ticketing and transaction platform called Hive which uses an open source Web-standard approach to run transactions and work seamlessly with customers' membership records in Salesforce. Both institutions recognize the complexity and stress of developing these systems. And yet, both ACMI and Mia took this route. The session will explore key details of each project, including the following: - Why a ticketing project? What problem(s) were we trying to solve? - How each platform was built; - Similarities/differences between the organizations and projects; - Integration—the word that scares all technologists. This session is designed to be meaningful and useful for a number of different MW attendees, from senior decision-makers to software developers and the staff who spend their days working directly in ticketing and transaction systems. Attendees will learn real-world information about the technology, code base, APIs and UI/UX of each system. Attendees can expect an open discussion and active debate about the “best way to do this”—after all, not every organization can or should take the same approach. Attendees will take away practical knowledge about business systems, software development, and transaction processing that can be applied to their own organizations and professional careers."

We then directly connect these relationships to developments in new digital collections networks, such as the Reciprocal Research Network, which was co-developed by four British Columbia First Nations. We show in this paper how the very principles and protocols for conducting archaeology at Qithyil informed and guided the new media based production of the Sq'éwlets online exhibit and related physical exhibitions.

    "abstract": "Anonymously used in-gallery digital interactives may have lower barriers to visitor usage than downloaded apps, purpose-built devices, or even Web apps. But because of that anonymity—and their typical nature as single “page,” limited purpose, context-sensitive, nonlinear, or non-conversion oriented applications—they can present challenges in meaningful engagement data collection and user experience analysis. Both high-tech and low-tech tools and techniques exist, but these can be expensive, imprecise, intrusive, or time-consuming. In this paper, we examine methods and techniques to gather user experience and engagement data in inexpensive and unobtrusive ways, which we have been exploring over the course of several exhibitions and multiple installed digital interactives. The use of inexpensive security-style cameras combined with data forms geared toward rapid, simple input allows for more naturalistic observation of more visitors in less time, and for the collection of standardized, quantitative data. Programming of the interactives can include custom analytics events and rough session estimations based on user activity and idle times. These methods are not necessarily meant to be definitive but may provide alternatives where other methods are not feasible or desirable. In cases where other tools are available, combining these techniques may provide a richer picture of the overall effectiveness of installed interactives."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Art museums tend to develop online resources on the basis of physical exhibitions (both permanent and temporary) and print publications (the exhibition and collection catalogs). A good number of these online resources are labelled as either online exhibitions or publications, whereas some others are identified as websites, microsites, and interactive resources. While some art museums' online resources are easily categorized, many others would fit in several types. This paper aims to present research findings and conclusions relative to both producers' and users' perspectives on the definition and identification of online resources as exhibitions and publications. Art museum professionals who were involved in the development of online resources in major museums were interviewed. Their perspectives were compared with the viewpoints of a scholarly audience. One of the objectives of the research is to assess the way in which digital technologies transform and enhance the traditional exhibition and publication models. The presentation will delve into the capabilities and qualities of online resources that users and producers identify with the concepts of exhibition and publication. The research shows that both producers and users have views rooted in traditional conventions; for example, visuality is related to the idea of exhibition, while textuality with publications. However, within online resources, these conventions might shift so publications become highly visual, and exhibitions include more textual components. The presentation will also discuss the reasons why art museums might prefer to develop a certain type of online resource over another. For instance, producers are more inclined to produce interactive resources and online publications than online exhibitions or exhibitions websites."

    "url": "https://mw18.mwconf.org/paper/sustaining-the-heartbeat-of-your-museums-content-strategy",
    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Access to quick publishing tools like blogs and social media should make populating your website with great content a breeze. Add to that the digitization of your museum's collections, and the options are virtually limitless. But that's also the problem. With so many content opportunities, it's easy to suffer from choice paralysis. One of the keys to knowing what content to produce at any given time is to develop a habitual and sustainable content strategy. A benefit of cultivating a viable content strategy flows from a surprising observation made by Wired's Chris Anderson in 2004, when digital retailers began to outsell offline competitors. Without the limitations of a physical store, online retailers could stock plenty of obscure releases along with \"the hits\". And it turned out that there was a profitable market for these niche titles. When you tallied the sales from the multitude of niche titles, the total dwarfed the sales from the hits. Anderson dubbed this occurrence the \"Long Tail\" effect. Museums, like brick and mortar retailers, can only put the \"hits\" on display. The long tail of objects in the vaults remain out of reach to your visitors. But, thanks to digital collections, the most obscure and specific items can reach their audiences, too. In this workshop you will learn how enrich your museum's \"Long Tail\" with content that fulfills your museum's mission while contributing to its margin. We will discuss the following: * Building a content strategy that exploits the Long Tail effect for museums * Establishing proper expectations for how Long Tail content will perform and build value * Examples from museums of leveraging Long Tail content * How Long Tail content strategies can enrich a museum's featured content (content related to events, exhibitions, and scholarship)"

    "abstract": "How may we best utilize mobile augmented reality for storytelling and simulation of historical events on location? In this paper we present a series of design questions (and solutions) when developing an augmented reality application recreating the assault on Omaha Beach in the early morning on D-Day. To what extent may we select existing genre conventions from, for example, documentary film, and adapt them to a location–based audio–visual medium like AR? How can we best combine sequence and access, the narrative flow of an unfolding historical event with the availability of background information, in order to enrich the experience of the story, but without distorting its coherence? To what extent may we draw from existing and well known media representations of the Omaha Beach landing? How was the battle documented with contemporary means? We present the rich documentation of photos, films, drawings, paintings, maps, action reports, official reports, etc., and discuss how these have been employed to create the published simulation. We also describe the testing and evaluation of the application on location with visitors, as well as online tracking of its current use."

    "abstract": "Museums are considered active institutions that facilitate the possibility of self- directed learning and exploration. Decades have passed since the implementation of the Disability Act (1995), and we have seen the incorporation of inclusive practices in museums for a diverse range of people including people with autism. In support of this endeavor, this paper seeks to present a process of designing a museum-based application tailored to autistic children's needs. By adopting a Participatory Design approach, the paper attempts to capture the preferences of a case study group in co-designing an app for a Bristol-based museum. Initial findings emphasize the significance of adopting a participatory methodology in enabling users to provide feedback whilst collaborating among stakeholders. These were found to be key factors in the development of the platform. This paper will also consider the challenges that emerged from the participants' involvement, and how these influenced the design process."

    "abstract": "The digitization of art collections is a great opportunity to engage audiences beyond the context of the museum visit. Interfaces to access collections have been initially tailored for professional search tasks: the new challenge is how to design systems for open, casual, and leisure-based explorations. In a human-centered framework, the users\\' perspective is a fundamental step to design and improve creative solutions. How can we listen to and understand the potential users, in order to design meaningful experiences? How can we collect insights, and what do these tell us about the users and the systems? We explore the use of inquiry techniques as a method to surface the curiosities people have for paintings. During two iterations, visitors of public events wrote questions they had about selected paintings. 138 Post-its were collected and thematically analyzed. Results highlight that curiosities are contextualized, and that artworks are interpreted mainly as scenes. People are interested in meanings and symbols; they also displayed the use of fantasy and empathy. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of age, previous knowledge of the painting, and frequency of visiting museums on the questions\\' content through statistical analysis. While no strong finding emerged, we noticed that adults and kids likewise display an active role in the inquiry process, and that a previous knowledge of the painting is connected to more descriptive and atomic curiosities. In the discussion, we suggest design opportunities might lay in the interactive discovery of information, in storytelling-based descriptions, and in emotional connection. Our findings suggest that in leisure-based explorations atomic information might not be satisfying, and that descriptions should be contextualized to the painting. Our presentation will be an opportunity to discuss the value of the method, and to comment on how the insights could be embedded into the design of leisure-based experiences."

How can we listen to and understand the potential users, in order to design meaningful experiences? How can we collect insights, and what do these tell us about the users and the systems? We explore the use of inquiry techniques as a method to surface the curiosities people have for paintings. During two iterations, visitors of public events wrote questions they had about selected paintings. 138 Post-its were collected and thematically analyzed. Results highlight that curiosities are contextualized, and that artworks are interpreted mainly as scenes. People are interested in meanings and symbols; they also displayed the use of fantasy and empathy. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of age, previous knowledge of the painting, and frequency of visiting museums on the questions' content through statistical analysis. While no strong finding emerged, we noticed that adults and kids likewise display an active role in the inquiry process, and that a previous knowledge of the painting is connected to more descriptive and atomic curiosities. In the discussion, we suggest design opportunities might lay in the interactive discovery of information, in storytelling-based descriptions, and in emotional connection. Our findings suggest that in leisure-based explorations atomic information might not be satisfying, and that descriptions should be contextualized to the painting. Our presentation will be an opportunity to discuss the value of the method, and to comment on how the insights could be embedded into the design of leisure-based experiences."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "View counts are universally accepted as an important metric when analyzing video viewership. Views are easy to measure and easy to understand for all stakeholders. But developing a meaningful understanding of video performance and potential comes from metrics well beyond just view counts. While view counts are considered a measure of success or popularity, there are layers of additional metrics from which we can extract valuable insights to help inform key decisions and strategies. This analysis can, in turn, help to improve overall video viewership. An understanding of video analytics provides value across a video's entire workflow chain. Video producers, content managers, and marketing specialists alike can benefit from knowing how to analyze data and act upon trends—influencing the production, distribution, and promotion of video content. In this how-to session, we will look at video viewership data across some of the more widely-used platforms, with a focus on YouTube and Google Analytics toolsets. Attendees will learn basic to intermediate approaches for identifying key viewership metrics. We will review strategies for using data and analysis to help inform production, distribution, and marketing decisions. As part of the investigation, we will ask questions such as the following: How much of a video did your viewers watch? Where did the viewer watch the video? How did the viewer find your video? From which devices did your viewers watch your video? How do trends vary across devices, regions, or referrals, and what might that data suggest?"

    "abstract": "The website of an organization is its global public face in the modern digital age, and smooth functioning of the website is key to meeting an organization's mission. The appropriate Web server infrastructure and configuration are, by common sense wisdom, a function of the expected traffic patterns and the content served on the website. However, a challenging wrinkle in Web server provisioning is posed by high spikes in traffic due to specific unique events. A particularly dramatic instance of this challenge is faced annually by the 9/11 Memorial and Museum on September 11th, when website traffic increases by 35x To ensure smooth functioning of the website, the annual run-up to the expected high-spike day utilizes a myriad of tools, including best-estimate characterization of expected load; provisioning of a surrogate server infrastructure set up to best mimic the website configuration (and any special content/functionalities planned for the specific day when the high spike is expected) for the future high-spike time; incorporation or appropriate modeling of the caching and load balancing mechanisms expected to be utilized; user simulation and browser automation technologies to realistically mimic spike traffic patterns; and monitoring of quantitative metrics of website performance during load tests over adequate time intervals to uncover subtle issues that might manifest only under sustained load. Applying the set of strategies above has proven to be a time-tested and robust policy for the 9/11 Memorial and Museum to meet the huge spike in Web traffic on September 11th of each year. In this presentation, the strategies above will be covered in detail including overview of the techniques used to estimate future high-spike traffic, rig up surrogate servers, create realistic mock traffic, and best ensure that a website remains performant under high-spike conditions."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Skills matter. The digital literacy of the workforce remains one of the key challenges for the adoption of technology within museums (NMC, 2015; 2016). According to Nesta, the AHRC and ACE (2014; 2015), over a third of museums in England still feel that they do not have the in-house skills to meet their digital aspirations, and rather than improving, some digital skills areas have decreased. The latest findings (Nesta and ACE, 2017) report a \"lack of confidence\" as a barrier—more so than the cultural sector as a whole. Addressing this pressing issue, the aim of the UK's \"One by One\" national project, is to work over the next two years to understand how to deliver a transformative framework for museum workforce digital literacy. This paper is the first sharing, internationally, of the emerging findings of the initial phase of the \"One by One\" research. Combining museology with leading-edge employment studies, the paper attempts to evidence the development, supply, demand, and deployment of digital skills in the UK museum sector, identifying key actors and mapping typical employment patterns and skills policies. The paper shares how digital skills are currently developed and recruited, how demand is articulated, what skills gaps exist, and what challenges impede skill development and deployment. Furthermore, it explores the shift from \"technical skills\" to \"digital literacies\" — what this shift represents, and the facilitators and inhibitors related to this shift that are recognized within the sector."

Over the past decade we have worked with various contractors, revised our system architecture, migrated platforms, and developed a program of activities that support community groups and individuals throughout Wales in order to contribute to, and benefit from, the People's Collection Wales.

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "How do museums and other cultural organizations identify exactly how big their digital teams should be, how they should be structured, and where they should sit in the organization? And how do they define and measure digital success? We surveyed 56 GLAM organizations across the world to find out some of the answers to the questions that digital leaders are asking right now. In this paper we examine how these organizations are re-configuring their digital teams to define and drive success, and identify the patterns that are beginning to emerge. We explore the changing structures and relationships that digital teams have with colleagues, and what this means for digital responsibility in the organization. We include key insights and practical advice to help organizations of all sizes understand how best to structure their digital teams—by revealing what works and what doesn't—and help them identify the skills needed. Through a series of interviews with colleagues across the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe, we explore how digital leaders are re-defining the role and mandate of a digital team. Our findings reveal that none of us have yet embraced full digital maturity. The majority are still using a centralized model, but aspire for digital to become distributed across the organization. Yet that won't happen until we tackle a significant underinvestment in digital skills (most notably in data analysis and technical leadership), and until we begin to set—and measure—realistic objectives for digital success. This study presents a global picture of how digital is being shaped in museums, and conversely, how it is shaping our museums and cultural institutions today; we suggest next steps in helping organizations on their journeys to digital maturity."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "This paper shows how to blend cutting-edge image technology with creative curatorship to deliver engaging digital stories using a COPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere) content strategy. An increasing number of cultural heritage organizations are adopting the API standards provided by the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) to disseminate their images and associated metadata. However, the focus so far has largely been on the technical and data challenges that this represents, with very little attention paid to how these systems can be leveraged to provide enhanced experiences for users online. In this paper, we look at ways that IIIF APIs can be radically repurposed to go beyond the simple descriptive representations of an image for which it is largely used by museums (e.g. catalog metadata, transcribed document text). Instead, we explore the idea of using them to present a continuous narrative (i.e. story) focussing on various regions within images. We will take stories modelled in IIIF, and present them in a variety of exciting digital imaginings, using both established and bleeding-edge browser technology. These include the following: - Linear Web page (“blog” style) - Social media feed (deliberately delayed information) - Slow looking (deliberately removing text) - Interactive image (previous/next, plus freeform exploration) - Automated image (using text-to-speech) - Human storyteller (back to basics, with a digital twist) We will demonstrate the range of potential uses with a variety of stories taken from different organizations, including the National Gallery, London, the Endangered Archives Programme, the National Portrait Gallery, London, and even a poem commissioned especially for Museums and the Web. From this session, participants will be inspired to think of novel and innovative ways of telling stories using their collection images, as well as appreciating the potential of IIIF to make delivering these experiences that much easier."

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Discussions of openness in the cultural heritage sector often do not acknowledge that “all forms of openness entail forms of closed-ness” (Edwards 2015, 253). We need more sensitivity to what is gained and lost with different framings of openness. In the cultural sector, openness has political as well as practical implications, and associated closures, that require attention. This paper draws on the experiences of the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS), gathered in the form of research interviews in late 2016 and internal reflections on a major project to redevelop the NGS website. We explore the extent to which particular emphases around openness, including copyright and the need to focus on digitizing collections, took priority over other important issues, such as open data and standardization. We characterize NGS' strategy as one of \"progressive openness.\" The underlying infrastructure of the website was developed to eventually facilitate sharing of data via Web services to other projects or digital outputs, for example, ArtUK and Europeana, making it technically possible to expose and share data. However, this functionality and its implications were not well understood within the institution, and the widely shared vision of openness did not always include possibilities for making material available beyond the boundaries of the website. Assumptions about the website as the core location for digital objects left some opportunities underexplored, such as the opportunity to think beyond this website to the other places, times, and contexts in which people might encounter the collections online. Strategic attention to and awareness of open data, standardization, and the licensing of textual materials do not necessarily flow naturally from an orientation and commitment to openness. This paper explores this dynamic, and discusses how organizations might consider their own \"boundaries of openness.\""

    "abstract": "The Sarjeant Gallery is a small regional gallery in Whanganui, New Zealand. The Gallery does not have its own Web development or IT staff. The Gallery looked for engaging ways for visitors to browse their collection without assuming a prior knowledge of the collection contents. How could the collection be presented so that general visitors could make the most use of it? What interfaces could be used without requiring the Gallery staff to spend significant time reworking the existing cataloguing records and images? What areas were worth focusing on with the limited time and budget available? With the new website, the Gallery had three broad aims: introduce innovative features, make the site as accessible as possible, and meet current technical best practice. The Sarjeant Gallery staff were open to prototyping and experimentation and worked closely with Vernon Systems to see what might be possible with their collection data. Key fields of basic collection metadata are combined to create natural sounding sentences that are easier to read. Automated analysis of the collection images provided us with further options. The Gallery has received many positive responses to the site. Visitors are delighted by new discoveries as they browse artworks of similar colors and explore based on the subject keywords added by Google's Cloud Vision tool. Interesting connections between works from different artists and periods are emerging based on the colors, shapes, and image orientations detected by the computer vision tools employed on the website."

In this paper we explore how playful interactions and user comments can be used to encourage critical engagement with museum collections. This is done through a research through design experiment at the Museum of Yugoslavia, which houses the grave of the former communist leader Josep Tito. Building on earlier work by Mary Flanagan and Andrea Witcomb, we present a playful design that utilizes Artcodes to connect the physical museum exhibits with a digital experience of modernist monuments erected at various sites around the former territory of Yugoslavia during the socialist era. The design has been tested through two iterations on museum visitors and a group of experts on digital museum communication, leading to suggestions for future critical designs centered on playful intervention and poetic provocations."

In this paper we explore how playful interactions and user comments can be used to encourage critical engagement with museum collections. This is done through a research through design experiment at the Museum of Yugoslavia, which houses the grave of the former communist leader Josep Tito. Building on earlier work by Mary Flanagan and Andrea Witcomb, we present a playful design that utilizes Artcodes to connect the physical museum exhibits with a digital experience of modernist monuments erected at various sites around the former territory of Yugoslavia during the socialist era. The design has been tested through two iterations on museum visitors and a group of experts on digital museum communication, leading to suggestions for future critical designs centered on playful intervention and poetic provocations."

    "url": "https://mw18.mwconf.org/paper/possibilities-and-constraints-for-virtual-visits-experimental-approaches-to-vr-at-the-smithsonian-american-art-museum",
    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Starting in 2016, the Smithsonian American Art Museum undertook a series of experiments in producing Virtual Reality (VR) applications, in order to gain hands-on experience with the technologies involved, and to increase the museum staff's firsthand knowledge of the medium. The objective of the projects was to evaluate different types of VR—from relatively lightweight mobile apps to robust, room-scale experiences—in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each as a vehicle for delivering educational and aesthetic experiences to a remote audience, in keeping with an art museum's mission. This paper presents and analyzes two primary case studies from among these experiments. The first case study is SAAM's in-house production of “Renwick Gallery WONDER 360,” a VR app for mobile devices, created as a compliment to the 2015 WONDER exhibition at its Renwick Gallery. The second case study, “Beyond the Walls,” is a more ambitious, room-scale VR experience for the HTC Vive system, and was developed with support from our commercial partner, Intel. Each of these case studies centers around an application meant to offer a virtual visit to a section of the art museum galleries, and together they give a glimpse into the possibilities for virtual museum visitation in the future. The paper analyzes the costs, benefits, and lessons learned in each project, and suggests an approach and set of criteria for evaluating future developments in the VR space that could be utilized by museums both large and small."

This professional forum takes inspiration from three recent ambitious playful technology implementations, and will explore the risks and rewards of embracing new and playful technology video games, VR, and AR, in order to drive deep audience engagement. In a practical session, attendees will learn how the speakers evaluated the decision to embrace the unknown in order to inspire and challenge audiences. Speakers will include Becky Menlove (Associate Director for Visitor Experience, Natural History Museum of Utah), Dave Patten (Head of New Media, Science Museum Group), and Hilary Knight (Head of Content, Tate). The session will be chaired by Jessica Taylor, Managing Director of Preloaded. Key focuses for discussion: -How can technology intensify a user's experience of museum interpretation and its mission? What are the intended impact/outcomes for audiences, and how can the technology support that? - When is the right time to leap into the unknown with a new technology? How do you decide which technologies to adopt in-gallery to augment overarching curatorial objectives? - How much risk does an institution take on when embarking on an ambitious new tech project, and how is this managed internally? How can tech sponsorship spearhead innovation and new approaches to interpretation?"

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "In publishing content for the Web, museums rely on a range of staff, tools, and processes—some clearly defined, others less so. Developing a workflow and editorial review process can help organizations stay on-brand, consistent, and credible, yet many (including the writers' home institution) are still working to develop publishing models that consistently produce high-quality content appropriate to their online audiences. This paper explores the results of a survey conducted in late 2017/early 2018 on how teams in museums and other cultural organizations edit, format, publish, and manage content for their organization's websites. As this was a small, non-representative survey of 32 institutions, it shouldn't be considered definitive research on Web publishing in museums. However, the results begin to highlight differences among processes at large and small museums, as well as some potential trends in how museums organize their workflows. The responses also point to opportunities for institutions to exchange knowledge in specific areas, like sharing code or CMS resources and implementing accessibility standards. Though different museums have varying needs, this paper takes a first look at how some are currently approaching content workflows and structures."

The objective of the game's concept and development is to contribute to the ongoing body of work in how mobile games could be used to support meaningful social experiences within museums. Through the use of humor, the game encourages visitors to socialize within the museum and provide unique personal interpretations of the artworks. Through a process of iterative design, our research provides insights into which mobile interface design factors could inhibit or enhance a collaborative storytelling experience, and how a mobile game could be used to support a meaningful social museum experience by encouraging visitors to construct their own personal interpretations of the artworks."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "In 2009, the Getty Foundation launched the Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI) to convene and fund a cohort of eight participating museums exploring the possibility of publishing scholarly catalogues online. Six years later it was an undeniable success because all eight museums had produced online catalogues, and all eight were planning to publish more. The question for the museums, and for many others in the field watching the initiative's progress, was no longer whether museums should publish scholarly catalogues online, rather it was how best to do it. As reported by OSCI participants directly, and as seen in a number of subsequent user studies, there were three particular challenges many of the first catalogues faced, namely discoverability, longevity, and objectness. In other words, how are these books found, how are they maintained, and how do readers understand their boundaries and their status as formal publications. These challenges give us a roadmap to building the next generation of online publications, particularly by focusing on metadata best practices, multiple-format and static-site publishing, plain-text source material, transparent version control, and thoughtful UI. This paper delves into the lessons the community of museum digital publishers has learned so far, and begins to chart a course for the future."

    "abstract": "Gallery One has been an unqualified success for the Cleveland Museum of Art. After opening in 2013, individual attendance at the museum increased by 31% and the attendance of families increased by 29%. The pressure of improving on the successes along with the resistance to change expressed by some of our patrons has created unique challenges for our team. How might we reinvent the space while preserving the elements that our visitors value most? Through evaluation we have learned that visitors, although highly engaged in the digital interaction, do not always make the connection between the artwork on the screen and the physical artworks on view in the gallery. We wanted to understand why this was happening and to take the lessons learned from the first iteration to make strategic improvements in the second iteration. A primary challenge is to design a process that enables visitors to shift focus intentionally between artwork and digital, rather than have the two compete for visitor attention. We want to leverage the strengths of the scale and immersion of digital projection, combined with the physicality of gesture, the personalization of mobile devices, and ultimately, the power of an unmediated experience with artworks; we want to excite visitors to cross the conceptual and physical divide created by the museum's atrium and dive into CMA's permanent collections armed with new tools for looking closer. Our new focus is to create a tighter relationship between the artworks on display and the interpretive space of Gallery One. Come hear how our team has tackled these hurdles and how we hope to exceed the expectations created by the success of the original Gallery One, and how we plan to avoid the infamous fate of the “second album.”"

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "The creation of online exhibitions—delivered via the web, mobile applications, or kiosks—often requires the painstaking duplication of images and object descriptions that are stored in collection management and digital asset management systems. This task is further complicated by the inclusion of objects held by other institutions, whether they have been loaned for the exhibition or are present only in the online version. The end product of this effort is most often a digital exhibition that itself is managed within its own data silo and maintained in a format that does not facilitate reuse or discovery. In this presentation we will describe how the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) can benefit curators and technologists as they work together to build online exhibitions. Using examples from the collections of the Getty and the Yale Center for British Art, we will discuss how the interoperability provided by IIIF allows exhibition creators to easily assemble collections of objects from many different institutions; bring display metadata into the online exhibition without manual data entry; and enrich the content with annotations, such as highlights of regions of interest within images or allowing feedback from either select participants or the public, as desired. We will also demonstrate how the content of the exhibition can be reused in other contexts, because of the interoperable nature of the descriptions. The presentation will conclude with an overview of the IIIF-compatible tools that are available to support online exhibitions, as well as a discussion of the ways in which vendors and the museum community can contribute to the advancement of interoperable software."

    "abstract": "Building on the landmark work done by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights (Wyman et al., 2016), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) engaged the services of Sina Bahram from Prime Access Consulting (PAC) as the museum prepared digital interpretive programs for the re-opening of its new and expanded building. Together with interactive design partners Belle & Wissell, Co. we asked a critical question: how can we make the fundamentally visual experiences we were designing for our new Painting & Sculpture Interpretive Gallery equally available and engrossing to a non-sighted audience? Our goal was twofold: 1. To make large touchscreen graphical user interfaces accessible to the blind and vision-impaired; 2. To convey a sense of the artworks in the galleries, both in their visual aspect and the stories that inform them, to this same audience. By adding a bespoke digital talking overlay on top of the visual interface and following best practices laid out by Apple, Microsoft, et al. on their touch platforms, we created an approach that allows for an equitable experience for eyes-free audiences while still allowing us to achieve the full design vision for the experience. This paper describes the following: • Which design and pre-implementation considerations were made to help ensure an inclusive experience; • How a complex, visually rich graphical user interface (GUI) was transformed into a series of single-finger interactions in an equivalent and parallel audio environment; • What was required in both the technology implementation and the authoring platform within the content management system (CMS); • Implications of eyes-free use for physical design; • Implications of low-vision use, and use in tandem with a sighted companion, for visual design; • The content-related task of producing over 100 audio descriptions for artworks and visual ephemera in the wall and table stories; • Potential benefits to all visitors and to the museum's institutional knowledge about its collection thanks to this initiative."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "With the rise of mobile usage and online connectivity, museums are increasingly exploring concepts of “gamification,\" play, and user-led experimentation to stimulate new ways of connecting audiences to collections. However, organizations are often unsure about what their audiences really expect, want, or need from these experiences. Using a collaborative project from Aardman and National Museums Scotland as a case study, this forum will explore a range of issues around creating playful and meaningful online experiences. In the summer of 2016, National Museums Scotland launched a new online game experience in partnership with Aardman and backed by audience research with Frankly, Green + Webb. “Gen” (http://nms.ac.uk/gen) invites users to look after a unique digital creature, diagnosing its many ailments and then treating them to restore its health using real objects from the museums' collections. This forum will outline the core challenges of the project, exploring how lessons can be applied across the sector as museums increasingly look to embrace mobile technology and engage users with their collections in new ways. The Gen project will be considered in the context of other gamified museum projects created by Aardman, as well as widening our focus to other success stories within the museum sector. Frankly, Green + Webb will explore the importance of audience research as a fundamental building block of creative digital products and share insights from their past experience of working with museums. A range of key questions will be investigated, such as, how do agile methodologies complement projects involving elements of play? What factors influence creating an app or a Web-based product? Are heads-up experiences always better? How should you evaluate the impact of pre, during, and post-visit digital experiences? And, perhaps, most challenging, how do you shift the focus of digital production away from innovating with technology and towards innovating the user experience?"

In 2015, artificial intelligence went mainstream, and undoubtedly, in 2016, we will begin to see an increase in experimentation within the cultural space. In this presentation, we'll explore some of AI's most powerful uses related to machine learning and its impact on galleries, libraries, archives, and museums in the areas of collections, ticketing, and attendance data. We'll also examine machine vision; a computer's ability to understand what it is seeing. Machine vision can be used to inspect and analyze images. Imagine being able to classify all of your visual objects with the flip of a switch (actually, a few lines of code). We'll explore real examples of machine learning on the following topics: -Identifying subject matter -Exacting color composition -Sentiment analysis -Text/character recognition -Recognizing similarity and patterns -Art authentication Machine learning and vision are very powerful tools and are more accessible than ever before. In the hands of museums, these technologies will inevitably lead to interesting discoveries, rich data, and new paths into your collection."

To mark this milestone, five of this country's top science organizations have joined together in a year-long, nationwide celebration of our innovative past, and our exciting future. In 2016, the Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation, along with its STEM partners, began to create a digital storybook that would help create, connect and celebrate Canada's story of innovation. Rather than solely pushing out stories \"we\" felt were worthy of sharing, we took a different approach. We decided to take a more participatory approach, which required us to built a platform that would allow Canadians to share \"their\" stories of innovation through user-generated content. In this session, attendees will learn: - How to identify your audience and their needs - How to entice users (the public and partners) to submit user-generated content (e.g. campaigns, partnerships, etc.) - How to continuously engage a community - How to let go while maintaining relevant and quality content - How to embrace a participatory approach - How to build the required tools for successful user-generated platform - How to measure success - How to build a culture of innovation."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "A question museums face in the digital age, inherent to their mission, is how can we not only address and increase access to the institution physically, but also virtually? This session aims to share dissertation research and findings of the qualitative research study \"Museums without Walls: The Google Art Project and Smarthistory—A Mission Possible Prophecy.\" The results highlight the potential changes in pedagogy for those that prepare future museum professionals, from the words of leaders in the fields of art museums and academic art history. Our discussions with art historians, museum directors, educators, and curators reveals how they think and feel about using digital resources, specifically the Google Art Project and Smarthistory, in their own research and learning practices, as well as for those they teach and their audiences. The data collection of 14 interviews includes representatives from these roles and those who created both the Google Art Project and Smarthistory. This lens on both those in the field and those who created these entities draws a parallel between museum professionals and those that use or participate in either of these digital resources in their practices. Participants in the session will walk away with information on how leaders in the field feel about the shared content and interactive experiences that are available to those that prepare and teach future museum professionals, and how in the future, digital resources like these, aggregators of content, may offer increased access to content across institutions and organizations offering infinite educational possibilities. Most evident will be the impact that advances in digital technology are having on museum professionals, on the roles that exist within museums today, and the way that teaching emerging professionals in the digital age is changing."

    "abstract": "Online cultural heritage collections often contain complementary objects, which makes integration between heterogeneous collections a worthwhile effort. In order to do so, objects have to be adequately described. Crowdsourcing in cultural heritage is evolving to be an approach to collect annotations at scale, but faces challenges regarding sustainability and structured use of results in the context of existing collections. The DigiBird project integrates four distinct nature-related collections and serves as a hub for crowdsourcing systems that extend collection data. An Application Program Interface (API) is built on top of the DigiBird pipeline, enabling institutions to embed integrated results in their online collections."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "The digital era has seen the modus operandi of the museum shift inexorably towards increasingly integrative modes of interaction with its audiences. The New Media Consortia's New Horizon 2015 report identifies participation as one of the key drivers of technology adoption in museums in the immediate future. For their part, new media artworks reconfigure the spatio-temporal dimensions of cultural experience in distinctive ways. They may also extend the range of transactions that exist between the institution and its publics; in some cases, the character of these transactions is representative of the perceived social value that open access imparts within digital culture. Such socio-cultural developments are indicative of a postdigital paradigm shift that has distinctive implications for art museums. This paper seeks to explore how the currencies that digital culture exemplifies translates in important, transformative ways upon the perceived roles, practices, and values associated with curating. After setting out some initial problematics concerning the broadened scope of curatorial practices under contemporary postdigital conditions, the remainder of the paper will be structured as a set of discrete entries designed to offer a series of notes of a provisional nature that relate –in direct, illustrative and more overtly intertextual and theoretical ways– to the subject of cultural curating. This formative lexicon will deliberate over the mediating function of curation as the interface between the institution and various inter-actors or agents. While conceding to the speculative nature of these formative ideas, their intent and larger ambition is to initiate further research into how forms of curatorial programming influenced by the qualities of new media art and digital culture activate interactive, discursive spaces between the museum and its constituencies."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "The use of digital in the cultural heritage sector continues to expand, whether it takes the form of an online catalogue, mobile application, or social media exchange, increasingly affecting our cultural encounters and shaping our perception of cultural organizations. Cultural and higher education institutions around the world are investing vast resources on digitization and making their collections available online but still know very little about who uses these and how they interact with the data. In order to address this gap, the Scottish Network on Digital Cultural Resources Evaluation (ScotDigiCH) was initiated in January 2015, bringing together academics from different disciplines and professionals from Scotland's key cultural organizations and interweaving international perspectives. The aim of the network was to investigate how cultural digital resources are used by diverse user groups, how to record their impact, and how to maximize their potential. It integrated different methodologies and perspectives (from digital humanities, computing science, museology, social sciences) and used as a case study the Kelvin Hall Project in Glasgow. The Network has organized a series of four workshops, a knowledge exchange event and an international symposium on evaluating digital cultural resources (EDCR2016). All these activities have certainly given all partners a lot of food-for-thought and are informing all partners' digital strategies and how evaluation can be integrated to support all core areas of operation form collections documentation to exhibition interpretation and visitor engagement. The paper discusses the lessons learned from the ScotDigiCH research network, particularly the EDCR2016 Symposium, and the wider implications for other researchers and organizations working in digital cultural heritage."

    "abstract": "In this interactive session we will imagine and design a virtual reality art museum. The session will begin with the introduction of key concepts in virtual reality. We will then give an overview of how virtual reality is used in museums today. Participants will then break into smaller groups for a design session. To take the concept of virtual reality and art to the extreme, in our virtual museum we will showcase native virtual art. Native virtual art is not only viewed in virtual reality but is also created in virtual reality. Each team will think about one of the following topics: 1. Curation Team. In the real world, curation is limited by space and money. In the virtual world, though, what is the limiting factor on what should be included in a collection? Another question that can be asked is if in a virtual museum, should the museum experience be personalized to each individual visitor? 2. Gallery Team. The design of any gallery impacts how the art is experienced. In the real world, some galleries take the approach of using white walls so that the space doesn't dominate the art. In a virtual museum, there doesn't have to be walls at all. How will artwork be displayed in a virtual museum? How will visitors navigate between collections in such a museum? 3. Social Team. Museum visiting is fundamentally a social activity. The presence of others is an integral part of the experience. In the real world, these social interactions occur in real-time. In a virtual museum, social activity need not occur in real-time. How can we use this greater flexibility to enhance the visitor experience to the virtual museum? How can people share the art with their friends outside of the virtual museum? At the end of the session, participants will share ideas and come together to make a digital blueprint of the virtual museum. This session is recommended for anyone that is interested in understanding the role of virtual reality in art. In addition, come meet other people interested in virtual reality."

Artifacts and artworks become tangible touchstones that connect visitors to human rights. Digital experiences through virtual or augmented spaces extend the boundaries of progressive storytelling and education, placing the visitor at the center of an experience. One of the great advantages of leveraging cross-media and non-linear storytelling principles such as VR and AR is the creation of multiple entry points to a particular subject or theme, and using a multiplicity of interactive technologies to find new ways of experiential storytelling—all within the context of the museum. We explore two case studies: The Weaving a Better Future VR experience, which transports the visitor to Guatemala, where they can learn about the lives, history, and culture behind the TRAMA Textiles cooperative in Quetzaltenango and a shop in Antigua called Textiles Colibrí. The shop provides much-needed income for the women artisans who both run the cooperative and produce the textiles for sale there, using their traditional Mayan weaving techniques. The Stitching Our Struggles AR app uses compelling works of art, powerful personal accounts, and augmented reality technology to tell the stories of people who have used art to expose truth and motivate action. Leveraging new participatory experiences has resonated strongly with visitors, and has not only enhanced the museum narrative, but also the creation of narratives by the visitors themselves."

    "abstract": "In December 2015, the British Museum launched a new audio guide. Based on extensive generative user research (Mannion, Sabiescu, & Robinson, 2015), its design and functionality challenge the traditional notion of an audio guide and provide multiple ways to engage with content, wayfinding, and object information. We embrace the notion of iterative product development and wanted to improve the audio guide product that has now been \"on the market\" for over six months. Too often, the concept of \"iteration\" is used in reference to technological development, with user research limited to a/b testing of designs for immediate implementation. We took a broader view and chose to spend significant time and budget conducting evaluative user research to understand what we did (and didn't) get right in the first version of this new audio guide. In this paper, we explore and share four key points: our long-term goals for undertaking this research; our methodology for conducting it; lessons learned and advice for other institutions; and, our revised strategy for the digital product. Through our most recent user research, we were able to observe significantly different visitor expectations for and use of the audio guides amongst three linguistic groups, giving us the opportunity to consider how we may change the digital experience to accommodate these varied expectations and experiences. Our conclusions will be of interest to any cultural organization building mobile digital products, and especially those serving a multilingual population."

How do we make sure we are actually working on the most relevant products for our audiences and using finite resources as best as we can? In late 2015, in the lead up to a five-year program of museum renewal, Te Papa established a new digital strategy, traversing audience-centered digital product development, transformation, and digital capability-building. As part of this strategy Te Papa developed and implemented a new Digital Product Development Framework (DPDF). The DPDF was a new set of digital processes grounded in Lean and Agile methodologies to help teams identify, prioritize, and validate ideas; to manage resources, deliver new product, and continuously improve existing Te Papa's digital products and platforms. It consists of a set of clearly defined steps, using product development and managed product lifecycle practices common in digital-first businesses—and includes a starter pack of the best and most relevant tools we could find from Lean, Agile, and Design Thinking. The framework guides the product team through the development of potential product ideas from ideation, through prototyping, procurement, agile development, launch, and ongoing care and continuous improvement. It also allows for the wider organization to see all the work happening at any time, prioritize, and constantly manage risk. The DPDF itself was developed in a lean, collaborative, and iterative fashion. This presentation will discuss the development of the DPDF; the tools that form the main components; the roll out, training, and reception; and of course, the difficulties with actual implementation."

    "abstract": "The last two years has seen a growing number of experiments in contextually aware digital experiences in museums. However, most are stand-alone experiences (mobile, Web, signage) isolated from other digital projects and the core visitor experience. In 2016 The Asian Art Museum in San Francisco partnered with Guidekick to embark on an ambitious digital strategy to create an interconnected suite of visitor services across mobile, touch displays, digital signage, and the Web. This paper starts with a comprehensive look at the Asian Art Museum's digital strategy process, then presents a case study for the digital wayfinding experience from inception through initial public rollout. The findings are discussed to show the success of each platform independently as well as consider how usage is compounded when a visitor session is passed between platforms (for example, delivering wayfinding directions from a touch kiosk to a location-aware native mobile app). We'll also explore the museum's perspective on overcoming organizational challenges along the way."

The user experience and engagement with mobile products are greatly dependent on a multiplicity of factors such as social context, time availability, noise and distraction level, personal comfort, and individual goals, all of which are related to the users' setting. Developing an app that bears user location in mind can ultimately assist with successfully reaching a larger audience and extending the mobile product's life cycle in the sense that mobile apps are disposable products. In order to understand user behaviors with one mobile app in different surroundings, we turn to analytic tools. As simple as this may seem, knowing the location of the device (and therefore the user) is not a trivial exercise, yet this information is paramount for comparing other user metrics. We suggest comparisons of user metrics with inaccurate location data compromises the study. For example, Google Mobile Analytics, one of the most popular tools, reports not on the location of the device but rather on the location of the Internet Service Provider, meaning that international or out-of-state visitors at the museum may be misleadingly reported as engaging with the app at their place of origin. Using the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History mobile app, Skin & Bones, as a case study on location-based user behavior, we describe how we customized Google Mobile Analytics through events coding, filtering and segmentation analysis to retrieve accurate location data, which allowed us to compare app sessions taking place inside and outside of the Museum."

    "url": "https://mw17.mwconf.org/paper/museumlove-working-together-to-promote-local-cultural-institutions",
    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "As digital engagement specialists in today's world, we are faced with an ever-changing landscape. New technologies are introduced regularly, each day we face pressure to re-capture audiences and exploit the new hashtags, and the answer to “how to engage millennials” seems to shift hourly. In mid-sized and small museums, this role is often filled by a single individual, so we're often left tweeting as fast as we can just to stay in place. In this paper, we bring together three online engagement specialists from diverse backgrounds, different departments, and different museums to open discussion about the benefits of co-promotion, instead of competition, between mid-sized museums. In particular, we want to focus on three topics, using examples from our own experiences: 1. We propose that by emphasizing a broader #museumlove on social media, we are being advocates of not just our institution but cultural organizations around our city. Instead of focusing on pulling attention away from each other online, we promote visiting multiple museums and emphasize our individual uniqueness. 2. We propose the #museumlove creates an opportunity for open discussion between institutions. In order for co-promotion to work, we need to have knowledge of each others' museums. This also leads to broader discussion about the work we are doing. By sharing successes and failures with other local cultural institutions, we can grow in a way that we wouldn't be able to within our own institution. 3. We propose that co-promotion allows for the humanization of our digital accounts, which creates a stronger connection to the audience and visitors. By creating in-person connections with one another and with key influencers, we are able to create more meaningful connections that lead to more prolonged engagement online. Co-promotion has had a positive impact for our area and institutions, and we aim to generate discussion and open this subject to the floor."

    "abstract": "As museums continue to expand their digitization efforts, many now include a focus on how to understand and improve the impact of access to these previously inaccessible resources. How are different audiences using these collections? How are they impacting the work of scholars, educators, students, and enthusiasts? This paper addresses the potential impact of access to these resources on students through an analysis of an ongoing research and evaluation effort at the Smithsonian. Beginning in 2013, and more intensively throughout 2016, the Smithsonian Center for Learning and Digital Access has explored the potential educational impact of access to its nearly two million digitized museum, library, and archival resources. Their efforts are designed to meet the online needs of this target group via a platform called the Smithsonian Learning Lab, a new Web-based platform (launched in June of 2016) for the discovery and creation of personalized learning experiences. The case study project conducted research with students to make the Learning Lab as useful to them as it has been designed to be for educators. The methodology included student observations and interviews; a literature review focused on online learning and the use of digital materials; environmental scans designed to understand the features of popular online learning systems and social media platforms popular with students; and finally, prototyping with this group in the classroom. The project uncovered some specific approaches to guide the adaptation of the Learning Lab to better meet the needs of students, including approaches that could lead to the development of best practices for enabling educational and personal use of museum digital content by students."

    "abstract": "In 1952, Bell Laboratories developed what is considered the first speech recognition system: Audrey (Pinola, 2011). It could only understand numbers and it required the speaker to pause between words. Since then, other systems followed, each with a growing vocabulary set but each with different limitations on usage. It was only in the 2000s that speech recognition made a significant leap forward, first with the Google Voice Search application and Google Now, and then very closely followed by Apple's Siri. Mobile devices offered an ideal platform for practical uses of hands-free speech recognition tools. Both Google tools and Siri also relied heavily on the power of cloud-based computing, the ability to draw upon a massive amount of data pertaining to speech search queries, and an ever evolving and constantly learning analysis of one's own unique speech patterns, all of which helped these tools to produce the best possible response to a user's query. While not mainstream yet, the improved accuracy, as well as the quirkiness of these tools helped increase overall awareness of voice activated technologies in solving basic user questions. As voice activated smart devices become more mainstream with consumers, we at The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, have taken steps towards analyzing its potential uses on both a consumer and an enterprise level to assist our Museum community. In order to do this, we focused on the Amazon Echo. In this How-To session we will cover how we integrated the Amazon Echo with the MoMA Collections database and built it a new \"skill\" for answering queries related to modern and contemporary art at MoMA. The purpose of this session is to introduce voice activated technologies with a concrete and functioning prototype. We will walk through the technical implementation details of our prototype and discuss what MoMA considers the potential use cases at our Museum."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "In August 2015 the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and the La Brea Tar Pits Museum launched an innovative destination campaign called #HowDoYouMuseum that combined traditional and digital media. It was designed to both sustain the momentum gained from the museums' recent renovations, and to brand-align two institutions that had long been marketed separately. The campaign was meant to run for at least two years. This multi-faceted campaign engages visitors by asking them to share their experiences at the museums; the museum then takes the user-generated content and applies it as an additional marketing tool in both paid and non-paid media. In addition, the museums produced a series of videos starring (unpaid) local celebrities describing their personal experience. The aim of the videos is to inspire others to visit, discover their own experience, and share it with the world. This paper will discuss how the museum was able to generate more than three million views of their videos and reached more than 2.3 million viewers who saw their UGC posts in just a matter of months. It will further discuss the correlations between the campaign and record attendance numbers; the evolution of the creative; the use of both traditional and UGC to engage new audiences; re-purposing UGC for traditional media, metrics, strategies, and key learnings; and the challenges associated with sustaining a two-year campaign on limited resources."

    "abstract": "Over the past three years, the Carnegie Museum of Art has been working on Art Tracks, an ambitious project to create a standard for representing the provenance of works of art that works for both computers and humans. We will present a way to represent provenance as structured data, modeled using both the AAM recommended provenance standard and the CIDOC-CRM. This standard will allow provenance to easily work as a human-readable text, a JSON API, and a Linked Data graph. Once a work's provenance has been converted into structured data, we have the new ability to use this digitized information to develop insight into not only the works themselves, but the history of collecting. As this history is not institution-specific, we can use this standardized data to connect works across institutions, to tell stories that span history and geography, to enrich the discussion of the nature of collecting, and to provide a powerful example of the utility of Linked Open Data in the museum sector. We have worked to aid in the adoption of this standard by building a suite of freely released, well documented, open-source software tools that support and build on this new standard. These tools are built with a design philosophy of creating software that is usable across multiple museums, regardless of their existing technology choices. In this presentation, we will demonstrate how you can start implementing this standard in your museum, and what new capabilities this allows for art history, visitor engagement, and storytelling with the objects in your collection."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "The educational role of museums has increased worldwide in recent decades, targeting free choice learning. Cemeteries may also be considered as cultural heritage museums, once they have lost their characteristics as sites of sadness and mourning, and have become real places of memory. The cemetery \"musealization\" is an increasingly important subject of study in museology, fundamental to the preservation of these spaces as locations of famous people, tombs, and funerary art created by renowned sculptors. Cemitério Consolação is a burial place of many historical figures, including politicians, artists, industrials and many others, in addition to the site of hundreds of funerary art works. This article's purpose is to verify the effectiveness of a mobile application at providing self-guided visits at Cemitério Consolação, focusing on the educational aspects for users. Many visitors don't exploit a visit to the museum as much as possible due to a lack of information. Some technologies can help guide visitors through space, directing them to exhibitions or objects that match their preferences, or suggesting routes or other digital resources to interact with. This may increase the knowledge and understanding acquired at the site, challenging and stimulating visitors. We developed a mobile application using the following steps: cataloging tombs; bibliographical research; self-guided visit routes; geolocation and tomb photographs; information architecture and data modeling; choice of application technology; and application construction and tests. Planned routes were designed according to spontaneous visitors, and also to scholars' interests. For example, the script “20 must-see” was basically designed for visitors with little knowledge about the site and what they could find there. The search for a name of a sculptor or buried celebrity, and the search for keywords (e.g. \"musicians,\" \"poets\", \"chapels\" etc.) have great value for the site's explorers, facilitators, professionals and researchers."

    "abstract": "Electronic textbooks are quickly becoming the norm for K12 education, providing museums and cultural heritage institutions with new ways to connect to the modern classroom. Join members of the Ohio History Connection's digital team as they share their experience redesigning Ohio as America, an electronic textbook that has served as the organization's flagship educational product since 2011. While much has been made of K12's rapid adoption of technology, it underpins a much larger and more significant shift in pedagogy toward student-centric learning. More schools are adopting blended learning methodologies, the need for differentiation and extension has increased, and the efficient use of teachers' time has become even more paramount. Despite being regarded as the premier resource for social studies education in the state, a comprehensive evaluation in 2015 showed that Ohio as America needed significant improvements to keep pace and continue to grow. The team embarked on a complete redesign that included the content, structure, and the platform itself. Less than a year later, the \"2.0 version\" launched—an enormous undertaking that included more than 100 teacher-created lessons, hundreds of primary sources, and significant UX improvements. This session will include discussions on the following subjects: 1) website or Learning Management System (LMS)?; 2) working with teachers: pros and cons, do's and don't's; 3) teaching to standards, teaching to tests; 4) interactivity and Rich Media; 5) digital vs. analog: designing lessons with a foot in both worlds; 6) accessibility and differentiation; and 7) projects or products? The ideas shared in this session can inform any museum creating digital resources for K12 audiences, regardless of discipline or subject, and will include an open discussion about other digital engagement opportunities for museums."

Less than a year later, the \"2.0 version\" launched—an enormous undertaking that included more than 100 teacher-created lessons, hundreds of primary sources, and significant UX improvements. This session will include discussions on the following subjects: 1) website or Learning Management System (LMS)?; 2) working with teachers: pros and cons, do's and don't's; 3) teaching to standards, teaching to tests; 4) interactivity and Rich Media; 5) digital vs. analog: designing lessons with a foot in both worlds; 6) accessibility and differentiation; and 7) projects or products? The ideas shared in this session can inform any museum creating digital resources for K12 audiences, regardless of discipline or subject, and will include an open discussion about other digital engagement opportunities for museums."

A basic understanding of cyber threats, with a toolkit to combat them, is critical for maintaining cybersecurity. Cybersecurity refers to preventative methods used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Part one of our paper describes threats and approaches to protecting information, intellectual property, and the computer network itself from external, internal, and hidden cyber threats. An effective cybersecurity approach should include network firewalls and gateways, anti-malware, user access management and authentication controls, backup management, business continuity and disaster recovery planning, patch management, and software updates. These will be bolstered by staff education. Supported by your executive, the cybersecurity strategy will align with your museum's business goals and risk appetite. Part two focusses on cryptography (writing and solving codes) to emphasize that information security is a perennial problem. Historically, the potential rewards for breaking codes and deciphering messages are obvious: outsmarting enemies, exposing diplomatic secrets, or unravelling plots. Four examples (Ceasar Cipher, Mary Queen of Scots Cipher, Polybius Square Cipher, Enigma machine) demonstrate the escalating complexity of cryptography since classical times. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Current applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, electronic commerce, digital rights management and copyright—all of which are relevant to museums."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "Social media offers platforms and venues to develop interstitial spaces between museums and visitors. Encouraging such interstitial spaces, fostered through shared ownership with audiences, can be instrumental to expanding and diversifying museum visitorship. With social media, museums have the opportunity to relinquish authority, develop shared meaning, and increase stakeholders involved. Additionally, the creative nature of social media, such as Instagram, allows innovation and action in a large-scale manner. This paper will share one such project, Clevelanders, an Instagram challenge implemented during the Cleveland Museum of Art's centennial year. This project was conceived as a response the museum's founders, who began their collection by acquiring numerous Colonial American portraits. The museum invited the Cleveland community to create and digitally display 1,916 portraits of our community. We explore how social media can catalyze community action and creativity as a means of expanding the museum community. We will share challenges and successes. The team will then extrapolate ways that such projects can support and foster community engagement and audience development work in museums."

While our audience's expectations are increasingly shaped by the online world, museums largely still operate according to a “brick and mortar” model, with revenue generation and transactional workflows managed independently in departmental silos. Like many museums, The Corning Museum of Glass (CMoG) manages a wide number of transactions with its patrons, from admission and glassmaking experience ticketing to class registration, retail sales, and memberships. These functions are supported by several different systems and managed by diverse internal stakeholder groups. As a starting point in developing a more strategic approach to e-commerce, CMoG hosted a summit in October 2016 that brought together seven leaders in the museum e-commerce space (representing six diverse museums) with CMoG's e-commerce team with staff from IT, digital media, retail, finance, and senior leadership. Our paper synthesizes summit presentations and discussions the key themes and insights that emerged over the two–day event. How might we think about e-commerce less as a series of transactions and more strategically? How do we maximize the opportunities for revenue generation without compromising the collections that we hold in the public trust? What's really important to our audiences? When and why do you choose to build versus buy software? How can we support a more strategic approach through data-driven decision-making? What staff resources are required to support these new internal processes? What's the role of mobile in e-commerce? How might e-commerce help fulfill the museum's mission or expand our brand?

As a small team of two staff, the digital learning team at Shedd Aquarium uses an empowerment model so that all learning staff feel confident integrating with technology. SAMR can support integration and innovation with technology across many areas in a museum, not just education. Whether you are thinking of a gallery map, gallery tour, exhibition signage, or educational program, SAMR offers a framework to explore how you can substitute, augment, modify, or redefine a project. During this How-to Session, attendees will get a brief introduction to SAMR, hear how Shedd has piloted and implemented this tool, and learn from our iterative process and how we are evaluating successes and challenges that have come from the SAMR process. Then we will break into small groups to test out these tools and discuss how SAMR can be used in real world museum examples.

These informal learning domains were selected since people who visit museum websites may well be tourists coming from different cultures, and many people visit news websites almost every day, therefor people would seem to be familiar with their structure. Furthermore, these domains provide rich multimedia information for its users. To evaluate IAs of these websites, a simple, quick, cheap, and reliable method was used that is called the card sort technique. Findings of the study illustrated interesting and meaningful differences between users with different learning styles and among different cultural groups. This study also made a methodological contribution, showing that the card sort methodology could be used to show learning styles and cultural differences."

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "Over the past two years, the Spencer Museum of Art has embarked on several technology projects aimed at providing its audiences more robust and multi-faceted interpretations of its collection. The end goal was to create a unified, nimble, and adaptive mobile platform that would allow the museum to share interpretive content with visitors. With the mobile app and iBeacon technology, the Museum enhanced the gallery experience for visitors by increasing the accessibility of existing content, such as short videos and podcasts that feature perspectives ranging from eighth-grade students to accomplished art historians. The resulting product has allowed the museum to respond more directly to the needs of its audiences, engage a wider range of visitors, and offer an enhanced museum experience. In this paper the Spencer will share lessons learned and knowledge gained throughout the app development process with the hopes that other small to mid-sized museums will also have the opportunity to leverage existing systems within a single platform. We share the following points of significance: working under the constraints of a small staff, the Spencer, with the help of University of Kansas technology staff, capitalized on its strengths by linking resources; aggregating scattered interpretive information into one location for visitors improves discoverability of rich content and leverages existing interpretations to afford greater exposure to research and enhance content development; connecting the app to collection databases (which are already employed by a majority of museums) to deliver content directly to the app offers an efficient, scalable, and affordable way to enhance all visitors' experiences by avoiding the necessity of redundant data entry; integrating activities, academic unit assignments and curriculum, and a variety of documents in the gallery experience; and creating diverse opportunities for collaboration with other campus units and organizations."

Regardless of the type of institution and the purpose the new website will serve, all organizations face similar challenges when embarking on this process and all fall prey to common mistakes that can be avoided to create a living and sustainable website. Panelists from Ford's Theatre, The Andy Warhol Museum, and Interactive Mechanics share their experience in planning and executing a sustainable website redesign. Both museums offer a unique perspective with different purposes, audiences, and stories. As a large tourist destination welcoming over 650,000 visitors a year, the Ford's Theatre website must convey the multiple identities of being a working theatre, museum, historic site, and education center. While The Warhol's first redesign phase focuses on visitors planning a trip to the museum, we're thinking about how to develop a platform that allows for future development and transforms warhol.org into an authority and destination for information about Andy Warhol."

However, for practical systems utilizing wearable cameras, a number of challenges exist which affect the quality of image recognition. In this pilot study, we focus on recognition of museum collections by using a wearable camera in three different museum spaces. We discuss the application of wearable cameras, and the practical and technical challenges in devising a robust system that can recognize artworks viewed by the visitors to create a detailed record of their visit. Specifically, to illustrate the impact of different kinds of museum spaces on image recognition, we collect three training datasets of museum exhibits containing variety of paintings, clocks, and sculptures. Subsequently, we equip selected visitors with wearable cameras to capture artworks viewed by them as they stroll along exhibitions. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on each of the training sets for the purpose of artwork identification. In the testing stage, we use CNNs to identify artworks captured by the visitors with a wearable camera. We analyze the accuracy of their recognition and provide an insight into the applicability of such a system to further engage audiences with museum exhibitions."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Museums are full of possibilities for deep engagement, open-ended learning, and thoughtful reflection. Online, we have adapted to a digital culture dominated by the brief and transient: from character-limited tweets to evanescent snapchats. In the process, have we lost the ability to craft digital experiences that offer the depth and pace of our physical galleries? The news industry has struggled to develop business models that support the publication of quality \"longform\" digital stories, like the New York Times' \"Snow Fall.\" Museums have the assets and the audiences to develop storytelling experiences that are both \"big\" in their scope and \"slow\" in the rewarding pace of interaction and engagement; these experiences come naturally in the gallery, but creating equivalent digital experiences seems harder for museums. The Google Cultural Institute's \"virtual gallery\" format seems only to have scratched the surface of what is possible. We will use Wellcome Collection's \"Digital Stories\" as a case study in an attempt to create a \"big and slow\" digital product, exploring how the project broke some unwritten rules of digital practice in museums: putting stories before collections and allowing public engagement priorities to determine digitisation schedules. We will look at how the production process worked (and sometimes didn't) and share results from the project's multidimensional evaluation, showing how the public engaged (and sometimes failed to) with a big, slow digital museum experience. This paper will synthesise learnings from both old and new storytelling forms to explore the challenges and best practice for writing and designing big stories in museum contexts. Embedding our case study in a survey of museum experiments with \"longform\" and beyond, we hope to offer a combination of provocative thinking and practical insights to support other organisations exploring their own digital storytelling platforms and ambitions."

However, as the scope and complexity of these bespoke experiences grow, so does the need for administrative tools that facilitate their control, monitoring, and content production. The design of these interfaces presents its own set of challenges. This paper will survey multiple administrative interfaces produced at Cooper Hewitt and analyze their design, development, and use. It will assess the role of such interfaces in the larger context of the institution's transformation to place digital technologies at the core of the museum. Ultimately, it is the aim of this paper to share observations on the development of administrative interfaces at Cooper Hewitt in order to emphasize their growing importance in museums and present strategies towards handling their production."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Digital collections interfaces have been traditionally designed for audiences with an established interest and motivation to probe the collection for specific objects. There are still relatively few user-centric interfaces that encourage casual browsing and a greater exploration of collections from a broader cross-section of the public. In 2014–2015, supported by the Digital R&D Fund for the Arts, Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums (TWAM) undertook a digital research and development project with Microsoft Research and Newcastle University to explore the following question: “Can cultural organisations with a digital collection improve public access and engagement with their online collection through the adoption of Web interfaces and systems that more creatively provoke and respond to an audience\\'s exploration of content?” A user-centric collections interface was developed to explore this, and a software development kit was produced to allow the wider heritage sector to adopt the system for their own collections. Ongoing user research and evaluation informed every stage of the system's development and yielded key insights that recommended new directions for TWAM and potentially the wider sector. This paper will explore the results and contextualise them against typical online collection formats and their perceived limitations, as well as other research in the field. It will investigate the public impact of an interface designed to inspire prolonged and open-ended browse, rather than enable directed text search. This paper will argue that there are clear opportunities to deeply engage audiences, which have limited knowledge and inclination to search object catalogues, with visual collections interfaces that manufacture a public interest in \\\"discovering the unknown.\\\" As well as recommending design methodologies for developing digital collections, this paper will also ask questions about how this gathered intelligence can positively influence the practice of the museu."

    "abstract": "This paper sets out to discuss the opportunities opened up for sound and music exhibition projects specifically designed for displaying works of sound art within the scope of digital museums. Taking as our case study the \"Sound Diary\" exhibition, curated by John Barber, which has been on display in the Web museum \"unplace, a museum without a place\" in 2015, I provide delegates with the results of an exploratory study I carried out with volunteers for this exhibition. My main aim, of interest to both researchers in the social sciences and professionals in museum and music studies, involves investigating how museumgoers engaged with both the sonorous experience and the self-curatorial process. Ultimately, I intend my work to contribute to developing the burgeoning field of online music/sound museums."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "In 2013, the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC) needed a central facility for the ingestion, preservation, and delivery of millions of documents of many different types, accessible by more than twenty institutional departments and by Web users via websites, mobile apps, and public APIs. This system also needed to aggregate data from existing applications and become the sole API for all shared collection information. Finally, the AIC collection and content managers needed the highest flexibility in the DAMS user interface and a seamless user experience between applications. None of the solutions reviewed showed the flexibility and robustness necessary to fulfill all these requirements, except for Fedora, an open-source, community-driven software popular among libraries and archives, but scarcely known within the museum community. ~ Two years later… ~ The first beta release of the AIC DAMS, named LAKE, has been recently launched. It is an ecosystem consisting of several data stores and applications, all maintained by communities of educational institutions, with Fedora as their central repository. These systems store and exchange Linked Data natively following open standards. All the code produced is open source and available online. Stefano Cossu, the LAKE project technical leader, will share his team's experience as a case study for Fedora as the core information repository of a major museum. David Wilcox, the Fedora product manager, will address sustainability and shed light on the communities behind Fedora. He will explain how Fedora is supported and improved through an inclusive and transparent decision-making process, how the communities gathered around Fedora and its satellite projects work together to improve interoperability, and how individual adopters' needs are addressed as part of a larger issue, when possible. These factors highlight an alternative approach to the way software is evaluated, adopted, utilized, and maintained."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is an evolving set of application program interfaces (APIs) for image delivery, first created in 2011 by a consortium of international libraries. By serving your images and associated metadata using IIIF, you get the twin advantages of flexible image delivery and interoperability with a growing range of viewers and tools that promote digital scholarship and reuse. In this how-to session, I will provide a brief overview of what IIIF is, followed by a guide for how to implement it and take advantage of its many features. IIIF is composed of two APIs. First, the Image API allows on-the-fly generation of images at any size, zoom level, crop area, or rotation, simply by changing parameters in the URL. To implement the Image API, you need to prepare images in a suitable master format and serve them using dedicated software that will convert them on-the-fly to the desired output. I will provide a run-down of the available formats and software, followed by showcasing some examples of websites that already support this standard. Second, the Presentation API allows you to provide associated metadata (title, description, copyright, etc.), as well as relationships with other images (e.g., for multiple photos of the same collection work, series of photos of different areas of a scroll, or multiple pages of a manuscript). To implement the Presentation API, you need to publish your metadata using JSON. I will provide an overview of how this can be achieved, followed by a run-through of different viewers that allow visitors to view your collection in different ways, and provide a compelling user experience. Finally, I will give examples of how supporting IIIF can directly benefit your organisation, from the ease of updating website presentation formats, via the advanced features that can easily be supported. I will conclude with some ideas for how IIIF can lead to innovative new ways to present and analyse your collection images."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of tangible and embodied interaction for encouraging a multisensory engagement with museum objects and artefacts on display, by means of focusing on the subtleties of devising and planning for evaluation and audience research. Measuring the impact of new technologies is one of the main challenges identified in the 2015 NMC Horizon report (Museum Edition). The challenge is even greater for emerging concepts, technologies, and approaches, such as the use of tangible and embodied interaction in museums and other Cultural Heritage settings. Taking as an example two case-studies from the EU meSch project, from Museon and Allard Pierson Museum in the Netherlands, we discuss our plan for devising and carrying out audience research so as to “document,” analyse, and interpret the impact of digitally enhanced, tangible, embodied, and multisensory museum visiting experiences. Our intention is to provide an honest account of the different strengths and weaknesses encountered for all evaluation methodologies that were used, namely observations, interviews, video data, questionnaires, meaning maps, and post-visit interviews. We also share and discuss lessons learned, insights and best practices that could be of benefit for museum and audience research professionals."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Cultural heritage institutions have been digitizing their collections for many years, and while publishing digital assets and metadata online has had a positive impact to make them relevant in our connected world, digital collaboration between scholars has remained a difficult proposition. A main obstacle to efficient and scalable image-based research has been the lack of interoperability between image silos, and it is not a stretch to think that this might have hindered the progress of scholarship. Recognizing this obstacle, the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) provides uniform access to a network of distributed image repositories. The development of the technology and the various image viewing and serving software is community based, and the Yale Center for British Art is leading the way in terms of evolving both to support the requirements of scholarly research for museums. The presentation will look at the benefits of the IIIF standard and how it supports the institutional mission of generating the highest-quality research data, especially conservation data."

    "url": "https://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/mobile-from-responsive-to-mobile-moments",
    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "The last five years have seen rapid growth in the adoption of mobile, and with it the responsive design movement championed by Ethan Marcotte. Reminiscent of Y2K, organizations everywhere have kicked off responsive Web projects. And that was a good move, as 2014 became the year that mobile Internet traffic exceeded desktop traffic. However, responsive design was just the first step in a number of rapidly evolving mobile movements. There was also the mobile first movement, championed by Luke Wroblewski in his book, aptly titled, “Mobile First.” This recognized that some experiences should be designed as though mobile was the predominant platform, and with a view to the specifics of that channel, rather than only adapting from a desktop view. Then we saw the mobile-only movement, which recognized that some users only exist in the mobile space. 2015 was the year that the mobile-only audience became larger than the desktop-only audience. All of that thinking has evolved further into the idea of the mobile moment. That is, mobile usage is really a series of mobile moments, micro moments in an era of an expectation of anytime, anywhere, instantaneous information. It recognizes that it is distinctly different to how people use desktop, which is more focused on browsing, research, and working. Mobile moments are about the everyday questions we ask whenever we think of them: “What is that?” “What time are they open?” “Where can I get coffee?” “Which train do I get?” “I want to tweet this.” And the key is to design your mobile experiences for the mobile moments that make sense for your museum and for the point in the customer journey at which they occur."

    "url": "https://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/the-museum-innovation-model-a-museum-perspective-to-innovation",
    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts of the museum sector to build a museum perspective of innovation. More specifically, the paper presents a new framework for innovation in museums called the Museum Innovation Model (MIM). The model emerged as a result of Ph.D. research that included a number of museums in the United States and the United Kingdom. The theoretical framework of the model is based on three concepts—open innovation, social enterprise, and social innovation—each of which, the research observed, are growing trends in the museum sector. The proposed paper offers an overview of each term, with special focus on museums. It also argues that the MIM could be used as 1) a planning tool to carry out innovation or 2) an evaluation tool to scrutinize innovation in museums. MIM is structured to make innovation in museums scalable, replicable, and feasible to start and operate. Beyond the case studies mentioned in this paper, elements of the model can be found in museums of different sizes, management styles, geographical locations, and collections. This is informed by Nesta's various projects and Chesbrough's (2003) and (2014) work around open innovation and open social innovation, as well as Janes' (2010) discussion about the “mindful museum.” Finally, the paper concludes by underscoring that the principles of MIM (i.e., open innovation, social enterprise, and social innovation) are interconnected and together can present a formula for innovation in museums. The formula might be expressed simply as: museums that adopt a social enterprise business model and utilize open innovation strategies are capable of achieving social innovation."

    "abstract": "It may seem impossible to imagine teens without their cell phones. According to a 2015 Pew study, 88 percent of teens have them, and 73 percent have smartphones. Tapping into teens' extreme familiarity with mobile, the Seattle Art Museum has found a synergy at the intersection of its dual goals of increasing technology and youth voice at the museum. Using interpretive technology is paramount for SAM's vision “to be a great art museum for the 21st century.” With a new website in 2013, increased digital interactive experiences in the galleries, and expanded interpretive offerings on mobile, SAM constantly considers how technology can achieve the museum's mission of connecting art to life. In 2014, SAM invited the twenty-five visionary high-school-aged teens who comprise Teen Arts Group (TAG) to write and record their own permanent collection cell phone tours for the general public. This fall, teens will be building their own augmented reality tour for the permanent collection. With both projects, SAM is leveraging existing interpretive mobile platforms to deepen the ways that it can meet the goals of its teen programs: to cultivate the voice and leadership of diverse young people throughout the museum. The permanent collection cell phone and augmented reality tours not only have increased available interpretive content, but also have given TAG teens a lasting presence in the museum for all visitors. This paper would discuss the alignment of SAM's strategies for technology and youth engagement; data from the two project years; impact on the institution, teens, and audience; lessons learned; and takeaways applicable to any museum."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "During the Baltimore and Florence conferences, we presented our report on how two thousand museums worldwide related on Twitter. We analyzed the most influential museums on Twitter, the factors underlying the observed community structure, the evolution of museums' Twitter use, and the museums that worked as a hub. Last year we focused on three case studies about the relationship between a museum and its followers and how to use this information to design better social media strategies. This year, we focus the last part of this three-year-long research on two key points: 1) The growth of a museum's community in social media: causal factors, quantitative and qualitative issues 2) Factors explaining the spread of information across the network There are several aspects that make a museum's presence on social media different than that of a company, and these factors have an impact on follower growth and on the spread of information. The foremost of these factors are:  The lack of advertisement budget: even those lucky museums that have a social media advertisement budget lack the resources to base their growth on ads  The collaborative environment  The engagement that followers establish with the museum on social media We will run quantitative and qualitative research focused on gaining insights to improve museums' social media strategies through a more informed decision-making process and throughout analysis. Through several different case studies, we are going to analyze the real weight that this and several other factors have. What are the factors limiting a museum's real reach or growth on social media? Which percentage of a museum follower's growth can be attributed to this (and other) mechanisms? Which implications does it have for defining successful social media strategies? As in previous papers, big data and advanced mathematics are going to be used, but the final paper will be nontechnical and focused on the insights museums can get from this research."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Visitors to museum collections websites are often greeted by the search bar, the standard of Web content exploration. Most search bars work best when users know exactly what they're looking for and how to find it; many do not. Most Web visitors have little idea about the amount and variety of content that underlies the average search bar. Luckily, options for content exploration can go beyond this basic tool. From music to shopping to travel, websites from an array of industries increasingly allow easy content discovery. These websites take into account user preferences and patterns to help determine what they see. This paper looks at problems with current modes of content presentation on museum websites and examines useful models in and outside the arts and culture community that show possible ways forward. Outside the field, social media sites, advertisers, and especially music streaming services provide intriguing examples of content exploration. Within the field, institutions including the Rijksmuseum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art can serve as case studies for expanding and challenging traditional interfaces. The paper looks at the success of these models and traces Balboa Park Online Collaborative's early efforts to design and implement custom content and a generous interface for the collections of Balboa Park's twenty-seven cultural institutions, representing a mixture of museums, historical societies, and performing arts centers. The digital world has conditioned audiences to expect exploration and discovery. The technology is here. The expectation is here. Museums' relevance and sustainability is based on their ability to satisfy this expectation."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "How can museums become more personal—to connect better with each unique visitor? A visitor will have a general profile that is a combination of the visitor's background, topical subject interests, and learning style. We recommend a deep personalization strategy that begins with learning as much as possible about the visitor, with special attention paid to learning topical interests within STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics). Each visitor will enter a museum with a specified combination of these five topics, and so a visitor model can be viewed as a five-dimensional space with each visitor being a point in, or region of, this space. This region is termed a topical visitor profile. Systems thinking is one example of a profile that is pervasive across the four areas of STEM. We chose to discuss systems thinking within an art museum because we hypothesize that a subset of art museum visitors will have this profile, and therefore the museum is tailoring its object interpretations to these visitors by exposing them to systems thinking on any particular object. We describe a hybrid software/hardware architecture based on 1) the Physical Web concept, which represents a natural extension of the Semantic Web; 2) a collaborative wiki-style approach to curating knowledge about each object; and 3) a desire to seamlessly connect the informal museum setting with formal learning classes, subjects, and their associated subject standards. Deep personalization represents the broad goal described in the paper, and systems thinking is an example of personalization for STEM learning."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Cultural institutions have sought to develop social media as a means of engaging with their audiences. However, there is a lack of guidance about how to effectively evaluate performance. A study was carried out to explore contemporary practices in cultural institutions to better understand the challenges, methods, and strategies. This involved in-depth interviews with social media managers at eight Scottish institutions and a worldwide survey of one hundred organisations. The participants were asked about how they use social media, what their objectives are, and whether use of frameworks, toolkits, and strategies were useful or indeed feasible. Results showed that despite various approaches, many institutions share priorities and challenges. Although some preferred to be flexible, while others more regimented, there is consensus that social media helps deliver on wider institutional goals and strategies. There is also evidence that institutions want to better understand the impact of their social media but often have problems capturing or interpreting relevant data, and all institutions are responsive to tools that might help them do this. The research tested the principles of one tool in particular, the Culture24 Evaluation Framework. Discussions with participants revealed that while its concepts were relevant and valuable, there remained issues with how it could be implemented, given incongruity with existing operations. Consequently, the research proposes recommendations for developments in social media and evaluative frameworks. The research concludes that institutions that have more defined strategy, even if practices remain flexible, are more decisive and effective in their use of social media. Having objectives and cycles allows better implementation of specific tools and frameworks. Furthermore, careful consideration of the functionality of specific social media platforms allows them to more effectively address specific targets and metrics."

This current research, part of a larger study into how the curatorial staff at the history and technology museums of the Smithsonian Institution have responded to the challenge of collecting objects that contain computer-based technology, will attempt to illustrate how curatorial expertise, through contemporary collecting, can respond with agility and creativity to unknown types of technology. In doing so, the critical role that twenty-first-century curators play within the museum will be examined, and how the museum both contributes to and is influenced by modern society's understanding of these new technologies will be explored. What is emerging is a responsive and agile model of curatorship, one that has been honed by a long tradition of technology-related collection stewardship and that is fully prepared to answer the challenges posed by computer-based technology, revealing the museum as a trusted source for context and clarity in a rapidly evolving world."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "For all of us involved in the delivery of digital products designed to support museum initiatives, service design presents a provocative framework for designing, planning, and executing the next generation of digital products for museum visitors. In our increasingly personalized, distributed computing, and technology-dependent world, our museum visitors bring into every context more and more expectations about digital experiences. To meet these expectations, technologies in (and about) museums must deliver seamless, holistically designed experiences that appeal to the visitor before, during, and after the museum visit. The hallmarks of service design—user-centric services mapped to organizational mission and cross-department planning—are uniquely suited to deliver on this challenge. (Elements of this approach to digital project planning are already a part of digital strategy at many museums, but may not be named explicitly as \"service design.\") To illustrate how service design concepts can help deliver a more engaging experience in digital museum products, this paper will explore the following themes: - How adoption of service and customer experience design practices can help build better project processes, transform organizational habits, and ultimately deliver better interactive experiences to our museum visitors - Strategic planning and digital projects at the American Museum of Natural History that apply service design principles - Additional case studies of applied service design concepts - Implications of placing our museum visitors at the heart of our digital project planning - Challenges, shortcomings, and future of service design."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "In evaluating digital projects, the focus for many cultural institutions has been on quantitative methods, using defined metrics to identify and measure impact, value, and success. Continued efforts to develop standardised frameworks and tools, such as aggregate influence scores and dashboard templates, has meant that this is increasingly viewed as quick, broadly applicable, and easily understood. However, there remains dispute over whether this form of measurement, which places numbers and statistics above more subjective, qualitative response, is too reductive. This, in turn, prompts questions for us when evaluating our digital projects: • What are we actually measuring, and what are the numbers really telling us? • Why might these results be significant and privileged over other forms of insight? • Are we at risk of oversimplifying and narrowing evaluation processes for digital projects because of the abundance and relative ease of digital evaluation tools? While recognising the value of Web analytics, we have sought to engage with the above questions when designing evaluation of digital projects at Wellcome Library. Drawing from Simon Tanner's Balanced Value Impact model, we explore iterative approaches to evaluation through agile frameworks, which can be adapted to allow for changing priorities and iterated for the needs of different digital projects. Through a multimodal approach, we aim to combine rigorous data analysis with qualitative methods to reveal emergent patterns and behaviour, in order to better understand the often complex relationships our users have with our digital offer. This approach has generated rich, nuanced data, giving greater understanding of our audiences and clear pathways to improve our digital services. Though it remains in tension with many institutions' reporting requirements, it is an approach that is lively with possibility and accommodates the continual evolution and range of response in users' experiences."

    "abstract": "Artifacts in cultural history museums are typically enclosed in glass displays, decontextualized from their social and cultural origins, resulting in a \"look, but don't touch\" encounter. With reference to perspectives and counter-perspectives of the \"multisensory museum\" (Levent & Pascual-Leone, 2014), this paper describes our development of experimental interactive prototypes based on early sixteenth-century boxwood prayer-nuts. Our work aims to engage the historical, social, and cultural contexts through sensory interactions involving smell, touch, and sound, with visual and aural feedback. Given the neglect of smell from many museum encounters, we draw special attention to our conceptualization, design, and implementation of a novel smell interaction. Building on these experiences, we offer an \"intersensory\" intervention of the multisensory paradigm through our considerations for meaningful, contextual, and inclusive design with the senses."

Using specific examples, the authors present the thinking and practice of these new approaches to leadership in the cultural heritage sector, using applied lessons from the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia). An Agile work environment in a museum setting leads to success for the organization, its staff, and ultimately its audiences. This paper focuses on two essential points: (1) changes across the world today in the area of leadership can be applied effectively in the museum sector, and (2) implementing Agile practices, by redefining project management and seeing leadership as a service, drives success. The authors explore the day-to-day realities of making sweeping changes to the way that teams work and the subsequent impact on morale, productivity, and recruiting. Based on the work and writing of influential thinkers/authors such as Eric Ries, Stephen Denning, and Jim Whitehurst, this paper addresses the underlying need for change in the practice of management, describes the basics of Agile/Lean methods, highlights the advantages of self-organizing teams, shares real-world examples of hurdles and missteps along the way, and lists the results that come from adopting this new way of working."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Since the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) introduced a visitor-centered exhibition development process in 2013, user testing of analog and digital interpretive tools in both the conceptual and implementation stages has been a fundamental part of the process. User testing is an important tool in gauging visitors' interest in a specific activity. It also helps to determine if interpretive tools are intuitive, engaging, and easy to use, so that changes can be made before installing them in the galleries. The systematic incorporation of user testing in the exhibition development process has resulted in the implementation of a number of successful interactives, which have realized high take-up rates and have received positive feedback from visitors of all ages, thus contributing to the overall increase in satisfaction with our exhibitions. This paper will reiterate the importance of user testing, particularly when it comes to technology-based projects, and highlight some of the things learned in the past few years from using this strategy both in the front-end and formative stages. Staffers will also discuss different approaches to user testing and share takeaways from experiences with mobile testing stations and Test It Lab, including advantages and disadvantages of each model. At a time when many museums, and art museums in particular, are considering introducing user testing into their practice in a more methodical way, the IMA may be able to help these institutions make informed decisions about how to move forward."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Are you doing enough to meet the needs of your family visitors? Families are a major audience group, but making sure they have a good visitor experience is often left to the learning or programming teams without integrating it into the overall approach. And whilst families may seem to be an obvious target for digital products, many seem to assume that they are a homogeneous and consistent unit. In fact, a family group may cover a range of ages and knowledge levels, have varied attention spans, and have more practical requirements than adult-only visitors. Also, we know that most parents are keen for their children to learn and engage with objects in the museum, but often despair at guides in which they only engage with what's on the screen. So, how do you design good digital products for this diverse audience group? Firstly, we will suggest, by making sure you have a clear understanding of their needs. You can only do this by talking to and observing your family visitors. Frankly, Green + Webb use audience research to help create successful digital experiences for the cultural sector, especially on mobile. We've uncovered a range of fascinating family behaviours which we will share in this session, some of which may surprise you. We will start the session by looking at methodologies for carrying out family research. We will then share findings from work with family audiences for the Van Gogh Museum, British Museum, Museum of London, and Natural History Museum of Utah. From this, we have developed a set of principles that all museums and galleries should keep in mind when designing for families, based on a service design approach that aims to integrate digital into the whole visit experience for greater impact. Some short activities within the session will give you the opportunity to see how you could apply these principles to your own institution."

The Rijksmuseum, Free University Amsterdam, Center for Mathematics and Informatics, and Technical University of Delft developed the Accurator: a visual tool to get experts in domains like birds, ships, castles, etc. involved in annotating art and enrich the museums' metadata with expertise that is not available internally. In this how-to session, we will demonstrate the tool and the ways other museums can implement this Open Web application for their own collections."

    "abstract": "The museum visit is a collaborative activity: people typically visit museums in social groups, and conversation between group members has been highlighted as a key aspect for an engaging visitor experience. In this work, we detail initial findings and experience results from the design and evaluation of a group-based digital storytelling journey, where visitor-to-visitor engagement takes place under the frame of an interactive, mobile technology-based story. The results suggest not only the potential to cultivate social interaction between individuals using their own mobile devices, but also to generate immediate transcultural and transgenerational understanding and cooperation in situ."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Audience research has been undertaken in museums and cultural institutions since the late nineteenth century, starting what is a rich and prolific field of museum practice that, so far, has focussed heavily on program/exhibition evaluation and market research (Kelly, 2004). In 1999, I began my doctoral study asking adult museum visitors what sources they used when searching for information and where they liked to learn. Apart from books, libraries, and museums, intriguingly this thing called \"the Internet\" started appearing in visitors' responses (Kelly, 2007). This then sparked my long obsession with all things digital—there was something in this, I thought… After that research, I undertook a huge number and range of studies investigating use of the Internet and digital products, as they were (and still are) becoming significant ways for museums to engage visitors both inside and outside their physical sites to enhance their learning. These have ranged from museum visitors' online behaviours, museums and social media, students' views about digital learning, teachers and technology, social media and museum visitors, mobile visitors, user-testing, and trend analysis (Kelly, 2013, 2014, 2015a; Kelly & Breault, 2007; Kelly & Fitzgerald, 2011; Kelly & Groundwater-Smith, 2009; Kelly & Russo, 2008, 2010; Russo et al., 2008). To celebrate and mark twenty years of Museums and the Web, this paper reanalyses this body of work in the context of 2016 and reimagines who the (post) digital museum visitor might be."

    "abstract": "How can digital encounters between art and place be visualised and become a story about engagement that is meaningful for visitors, gallery educators, and funders? What does it mean to be inventive about evaluation? These questions have informed the work of the Artcasting project team at the University of Edinburgh and their partners at the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate, in the context of the United Kingdom's ARTIST ROOMS touring exhibition. ARTIST ROOMS is a collection of more than sixteen hundred works of international contemporary art, jointly owned and managed by Tate and National Galleries of Scotland. ARTIST ROOMS On Tour shares the collection throughout the UK in a programme of exhibitions organised in collaboration with local associate galleries of all sizes. ARTIST ROOMS On Tour puts internationally important contemporary artworks in many locations that do not routinely have access to such works and puts the task of making them relevant in the hands of local galleries and users. It particularly aims to ensure the collection engages new, young audiences, and this is mirrored in this project by a focus on young people (ages thirteen to twenty-five). Artcasting invites visitors to make an imaginative association between art and place and uses beacon and geofencing technology, combined with user-generated content, to create places in the world where artworks from the collection can be re-encountered—what we are calling \"artcasts.\" At the same time, the project has developed a framework through which artcasts can be understood in evaluative terms; drawing from Arts Council England's new \"quality principles\"[1] and working closely with ARTIST ROOMS and associate galleries to understand what practitioners and funders really need and want from their evaluation practices. Artcasting is an innovative digital intervention, but also an object to think and learn with, going beyond instrumental uses of technology to solve a specific problem, moving towards \"inventive problem-making\" (Michael, 2012)."

This paper will address an observed need for awareness and understanding of the role open hardware can play in museums and cultural organizations. Our mission, as members of OSHWA, is to develop shared, open source hardware that is useful for museum exhibits, educational outreach, makerspaces, and an overall more inclusive visitor experience. While the language of open source software has become more familiar in recent years, open hardware is a newer concept, and its value can be difficult to comprehend. This paper will begin to clarify how open hardware is an option worth considering, although at this early stage not always the easiest choice. Learn how your museum can join the small, but growing, movement toward open source hardware."

    "abstract": "In the spring of 2015, an advanced exhibition design class from New Mexico Highlands University's Media Arts & Technology Department redesigned the visitor's center at Coronado Historic Site in Bernalillo, New Mexico. Kuaua Village was a first-contact site between the native population and the Spanish entrada that was moving up the Rio Grande valley from Mexico in 1540. The redesign featured, among other updates, a new interactive \"Sim\" pueblo in which three-dimensional-printed pieces are placed on a responsive iPad to reveal information, animation, and clues to life in the ancient village. That project was reenvisioned using the HP Sprout, a device designed to scan two- and three-dimensional objects and then add them to a library of usable objects on a touchscreen and projected mat. For this demo, we will show the HP Sprout detecting individual printed objects, which are then made responsive as physical or digital objects. By moving the prints on the mat, puzzle pieces are unlocked on the touchscreen, and animations of pueblo life are added to the projection. Information about life in the pueblo from architecture, construction materials, pottery traditions, and agriculture is revealed."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "In 2009, the Getty Foundation launched the Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI; http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/osci/index.html), a landmark initiative to help museums make the transition from printed volumes to online publications. The OSCI initiative was completed in 2015, and the eight museums of the OSCI consortium have produced a diverse body of online scholarly catalogues (select catalogues are listed at http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/osci/osci_browse_catalogues.html). Importantly, we also now have an initial understanding of the reach and impact of these new publications. The Walker Art Center and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art have completed formal evaluations of their OSCI projects, which provide a rich body of evidence about how the catalogues are actually being used. The paper will explore the reach and impact of online scholarly publications and provide data and insights framed for the museum community at large: • Who is using online scholarly catalogues? • How are the catalogues being used? • What does the Web environment offer that makes online catalogues more useful? • How are the catalogues perceived by the target audience of scholars, art historians, and curators? • What are the drivers and barriers to the success of online scholarly publications? The research findings underscore the enormous potential for online scholarly publications, and even the opportunity for online catalogues to support new forms of scholarship and unique intersections between the museums and academic community. But they also reveal practical barriers to success and larger concerns around issues of permanence and status that are relevant to all museums exploring digital publishing."

    "abstract": "Innovation is crucial to the success of digital in museums, but innovating within a well-established product genre like the audio guide is potentially risky. New approaches can challenge existing business models, jeopardise revenue streams, and undermine visitor satisfaction. In 2015, the British Museum tested some hypotheses about how to improve exhibition audio guides through two large-scale experiments. This paper shares the results of those experiments and the experiences of over one hundred visitors and staff who participated in them. The findings are discussed within the wider context of the Museum's new digital strategy that emphasises speed to market and continuous optimisation. We draw on Christensen's model of innovation to make recommendations about how to evolve a product strategy for audio guides that appeals to existing audiences and attracts new ones."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "The need for museum strategy to be audience driven is now directed and enabled (in an accelerated way) by digital technologies. This allows, or requires, museums to understand the intersection between the needs of those it hopes to serve and the capacity of its own organization to meet them: to provide customized experiences and opportunities to unique audience groups. Educators are one of museums' historically most-valued audiences. Opportunities to have greater impact with teachers, their students, and the learning experiences they create, are great—greater than in the past, when museums focused on adult programming, school visitation, and exhibition-centered lesson plans. These new opportunities lie primarily in the utilization of museum collections and resources within the classroom, where the teacher can make use of them in ways that fit naturally into the learning process they have already developed for their students. To enable this, as we should, museums need to understand this group and how they use digital assets to design and deliver learning experiences. This study looks towards the development of a reusable framework for addressing this need through an understanding of the evolving role of the museum in the education space, the process and knowledge bases required for teachers to be designers of learning resources, and finally the ways that technology itself (in this case, primarily the Web) changes the nature of teaching and learning. The framework proposed is used to develop a survey instrument that is then tested through a case study of an emergent digital platform for teachers, the Smithsonian Learning Lab."

    "abstract": "As part of a grant-funded project that began in September 2013, the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) is digitizing its collection of over twenty-three thousand artworks as a two-part initiative. High-resolution photography of artwork not previously photographed and establishing the technical framework to publish this content constitute the first part. The second involves extensive cataloging of these works; the digitization of rich, supplementary contextual content for those works; and developing technical processes to route content internally, link content to both existing internal digital resources and external taxonomies, and harvest content for publication online via a collections API. Examples of this supplementary digital content include artist and designer biographies; catalogue essays; cultural and geographical descriptions; definitions of materials, processes, and art historical terms; smartphone assets, program recordings, and other multimedia assets; contextual images; related Web resources; and teacher resources. This paper and presentation will overview the challenges, iterations, and successes related to the management of the project from the technical, administrative, and interpretive perspectives. Reflecting on the trials and errors of our process thus far, this presentation and paper will strive to illuminate effective, interdepartmental strategies to rendering extensive object research accessible and easily navigable to online visitors. Additionally, we will provide insight into both the interpretive and technical approaches to creating rich connections between a vast and broad collection through associations with thematic content."

    "abstract": "Two years ago, the Prado website was reaching the end of its useful life. Since its launch in 2007, it had become the reference and main access to Prado's information for the general public. Prado's most important asset is the Collection, and this was the axis of the new website project. The Collection would be the center. Besides, after several changes in the Internet paradigm, the Prado needed a new website with new features, including the basic checklist of a modern website: responsive design, markup language, greater integration with social networks, broadcasting multimedia content, etc. But the key point and most relevant feature of the project was that the Prado's new website was going to be based on the principles of semantic web, a structured data website that would shift the use of the Collection's documentation. It required the creation of a digital semantic model defined by a methodology based on different ontological standards. The final proposal was a faceted search engine at the service of the general public that would be able to explore the Collection in many different and new ways. The aim was to generate contexts and other recommendation systems with internal and external content. For the near future, our aim is to bring value to each other's content by interconnecting our Museum's document database with other museums and cultural institutions as part of the Linked Open Data Project."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "The last two years have seen an extraordinary expansion in the number of massive open online courses (MOOCs) around the world. This proliferation of programmes (in diverse subjects, at all levels of expertise and styles of delivery) has been accompanied by a debate on both the value this provision may have for learners and the return it may offer to the learning providers. MOOCs, after all, flip the traditional university model. Rather than managing student numbers, MOOCs potentially accommodate a simultaneous learning cohort of thousands—if not tens of thousands. Rather than place the learning experience behind a pay wall of tuition fees, MOOCs instead can open up their teaching for free. Rather than maintaining admission criteria (built around prior academic attainment and experience), MOOCs are open to all with an internet connection. Rather than leading to a recognised accredited award, most (though not all) are sub-award, in many cases resulting in simply a certificate of participation. And rather than having direct and regular contact and access to faculty and expert scholars, many of these MOOCs mobilise the learning community itself to self-regulate, moderate, and support learners. This paper draws upon a two-year pilot run by the University of Leicester into designing and delivering MOOCs, including in the area of museum studies. The paper describes how the development of MOOCs at Leicester has, evidently, had an impact on the way the institution is beginning to think more generally about both its distance-learning provision and the role of digital social-learning environments within all of its teaching offers, on and off campus. Specifically, the paper looks at the development and impact of \"Behind the Scenes at the 21st Century Museum,\" a MOOC developed by Leicester's School of Museum Studies in partnership with National Museums Liverpool."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Tangible interaction offers new ways to engage users with digital systems through material means. We use ubiquitous computing to create reactive spaces and smart objects that seamlessly blend with the surroundings or the exhibition and bridge the gap between the physical and the digital. The technology is intentionally concealed to bring places and stories from the past into the present and create immersive experiences where technology complements heritage (as opposed to compete with it for visitors' attention). The full integration of technology with the exhibition or heritage requires approaching the design of the visitors' experience as a collaborative project that combines curatorial, technical and design aspects. As a multi-expertise team, we created, implemented, and evaluated thee concepts: an evocative experience in the trenches and camp of World War I in the Italian Alps; an interactive layer to tell the personal stories of those involved in the changes in The Hague during the Nazi occupation; and a set of multimedia installations to enrich a permanent collection of World War I artillery. The design effort was on both the creation of bespoke devices and the composition of content that was not didactic but open to personal interpretation: curators left traces for visitors to pick up, and when this occurred the experience was deeper and stronger. Our evaluations show that the powerful outcome cannot be ascribed to just one component, technology versus content. One empowers the other: an approach that simultaneously works on interaction and content is essential to make a design that exploits the place or the objects to a powerful final effect. Clearly, this challenges the traditional exhibition design process as curators become creative members of the team in charge of shaping, through the content, the final experience of the visitors. It is then a matter of rethinking not only the technology for heritage, but also the process, and for curators to become more daring with content."

Although it was initially intended to be a only digital resource, the quality of the produced work and the great interest in the project all around soon led to the development of a major exhibition in 2015: Gallipoli in Minecraft. During the development of the exhibition, the Museum team explored new ways of working to truly co-design it together with its target audience. This meant: • Turning a learning programme into an exhibition • Having youths involved with the process all the way • Embracing gaming culture as an educational vehicle • Bringing virtual reality technology into the galleries This case study demonstrates the elements needed to successfully run an outreach programme with youths and how to involve them to co-design a truly immersive exhibition experience that works across all ages and cultural backgrounds."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Museum Victoria (MV) in Melbourne, Australia, has strongly progressed along the digital path. Even so, we decided to create a digital transformation strategy to confirm and elaborate on our commitment to digital transformation as expressed in our overarching strategic plan. A broad survey of the digital terrain in museums and beyond was undertaken before and during the project to create the \"Digital Transformation Strategy 2015–2020\" (DTS). During the intensive period of strategy development, the focus inevitably narrowed as we developed our own individual digital transformation strategy using a defined project management approach. As the project neared completion, the focus expanded again as the implications of our ambition became clearer: the impacts and issues that would need to be addressed in order to deliver the comprehensive roadmap of projects while simultaneously remaining open to new digital possibilities, opportunities, and demands. The solution was to create a balance between digital aspirations and development principles (how we will do digital) and the categories and roadmap of projects (what we will do). The paper thus comprises two parts: 1. Project process to develop the DTS, and the resulting DTS 2. Issues emerging from the DTS and MV responses: a. Strategy versus digital strategy: Which to develop? b. Change versus transformation versus disruption: What is the goal? c. Stability versus agility: What is the role for ICT? d. Sourcing technical development capability: Buy, build, or borrow? e. Cloud as a service delivery model: What is its role? f. Choosing a project delivery method: Agile or waterfall? Writing a strategy is intensive, demanding, and challenging. If they are truly fit-for-purpose, no two strategies will be alike. However, sharing process, outcomes, issues, and responses has value beyond Museum Victoria. In the end, there are no hard and fast answers beyond understanding your stakeholders, your museum, and your goals—and working to deliver them."

    "abstract": "This paper will concentrate on an exciting and increasingly emerging technology, virtual reality (VR), and detail our examinations of the value of virtual reality environments for learning by children and young people, schools, and families at the British Museum. As part of the digital learning programme at the Museum, the Samsung Digital Discovery Centre (SDDC) provides family, teen, and school visitors with drop-in and bookable activities. The SDDC recently incorporated VR technology into its programme for the first time in a two-day family event. The development of the event as well as critical learning from the project and future plans for the technology within the SDDCs digital learning programme will be discussed. The Virtual Reality Weekend held in the British Museum on August 8–9, 2015, was the first time VR devices had been used to engage families with British Museum collections. Visitors were able to explore a virtual reality Bronze Age site, where they saw three-dimensional scans of objects placed in their original setting. Participants were able to explore multiple interpretations of how the objects might have been used in the past across three digital platforms. As the British Museum was one of the first museums in the world to incorporate VR technology into its learning programme, this paper will contribute to sector learning as this emerging technology potentially becomes increasingly prevalent, offering some of our key learnings from the project, as well as highlighting the importance of working closely with internal departments and detailing the benefits of using open source digital assets. It will conclude with evaluation outcomes as well as the results of trials of the use of VR technology for learning purposes across our audience segments, including with teens and secondary school students."

Having left positions within museums in the United States and United Kingdom, we have spent the last two years working within the broader cultural sector, as well as researching companies across industries as varied as travel, hospitality, banking, retail, and more. During that time, we've had the opportunity to reflect on larger trends, including the development of organizational strategies to bridge gaps, techniques to support efforts, and ways to lead progress. We have also encountered the use of various methods to execute on those strategies and have observed their impact. Perhaps most relevant, we have witnessed how companies are facing the changing relationship of physical and digital and the emerging formats and technologies that enable new kinds of experiences. Where do museums fit within these broader trends, and what lessons can be gleaned and applied within the museum sector right now and in the near future? This paper and associated conference presentation look at key issues facing museums and explore how some of the broader trends and approaches beyond the field can be distilled and used to inform, support, or amplify the work currently taking place within museums."

    "abstract": "We will present the research, process, and results of the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History homepage redesign to illustrate a visitor-driven, mobile-first design approach to museum projects. Led by Executive Director Nina Simon, the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History is a Participatory Museum. Everything from our programming to our communications is premised on an understanding of the needs of our communities; we start with the people and work back to the museum. So in redesigning our homepage, we asked, “How can we use knowledge of our visitors' motivations to deliver a focused, user-focused mobile Web experience?” In his book “Identity and the Museum Visitor Experience,” John Falk outlined a predictive model of visitor experience designed to help museum professionals better meet their visitors' needs. Through research with dozens of museums and thousands of visitors, Falk established his predictive model of visitor experience. This work is widely shared expertise in the field, but most of his suggestions apply to facility and exhibition design. We took it to the Web. Falk's framework identifies museum visitor motivations as: Experience Seeker; Explorer; Facilitator; Recharger; and Hobbyist/Professional. We will demonstrate how this research was applied to our homepage redesign project, adjusting the visitor archetypes to fit our local audience. Our fleshed-out personas included descriptions of how each intrinsic motivation tracks to museum programming and engagement opportunities; and what kinds of messaging and imagery they may positively respond to. Each identity was then mapped to a section on our homepage, where it informed the visual and content strategy. We will also share the research and analysis that informed our streamlined information architecture and how the visitor-motivation model is being woven into decision making and communication across the museum."

    "abstract": "The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), in collaboration with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and the Exploratorium in San Francisco, has led the development of an innovative model of teacher professional development. In its initial incarnation, the project has allowed secondary school teachers in three different metropolitan regions across the country to deepen their understanding—online, at AMNH, and in the partnering informal science institutions—of the brain science that is at or near the top of scientific research agendas for the twenty-first century. This has been achieved through the creation of a novel online graduate course focusing on the workings of the brain, as well as its evolution in humans and other species. That online course, suitably modified, has served as the touchstone for a course conducted across the San Francisco, Denver, and New York regions that blends both online and in-person elements. The described effort has leveraged AMNH's longstanding commitment to online professional development, a traveling exhibition on the human brain, and a strong track record of robust partnerships. The two-year project has engaged secondary teachers and supported the improvement of classroom practice. During this period, approximately one hundred and fifty teachers have participated in blended learning across the three project sites, with an additional two hundred teachers participating in the purely online course. The project design, development, and implementation, as well as its independent evaluation by Inverness Research Associates, will be described more fully in the submitted paper and presentation. This project has been conducted with the generous support of the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations."

This gallery is an open-ended, cross-disciplinary collaborative space for research and development into new modes of inquiry, interaction, and display in the realm of the art museum digital experience. While digital platforms are often built for a single purpose, permanent project, or temporary exhibition, our aim was to create a platform that targets a variety of uses and can be changed with one click of a mouse. The Lightbox Gallery is this platform. In this paper, we discuss our decision making about the design of the Lightbox, the hardware we've deployed, the software frameworks we've developed, the projects and programs that have taken advantage of it, and the lessons learned during the inaugural year."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "There has been considerable interest in recent years among both scholars and curators in developing a subject classification system that could be utilized across museums (and also across galleries, libraries, and archives). This paper will argue that the answer lies in a synthetic approach to classification grounded in basic concepts: those for which there is broadly shared understanding across communities. This paper shows how a synthetic approach using basic concepts would enhance user access while easing classificatory challenges. It then applies a synthetic approach to samples of museum artifacts. It is hoped that this exercise both establishes the feasibility of a synthetic approach and identifies strategies for pursuing this approach. Such an approach is easy for classificationist, classifier, and user to master. Curators, with their detailed understanding of artifacts, should be able to classify—or supervise classifiers—without needing detailed training in information science. The inherent flexibility of the approach allows each museum to signal the unique attributes of each object. Yet a simple but shared vocabulary nevertheless facilitates searches across institutions. Importantly, this approach is well suited to the needs of the Semantic Web, and thus allows museums to code their databases so as to facilitate computer navigation. Museum artifacts might be usefully classified in terms of their purpose, material composition, and (for some items) methods of manufacture (provenance is beyond the scope of this paper). A synthetic approach is useful for all three: (axe)(for)(war); (wooden)(shaft)(steel)(head); (mass)(produced). A synthetic approach also allows these to be combined into one longer subject entry. This approach would allow the classifier to stress the most important characteristics of a particular artifact. Such an approach may better identify artifacts whose uniqueness lies in unusual combinations of the three elements: (golden)(axe)."

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in the technologies needed to digitize, publish, and print scientific and cultural heritage resources in three dimensions (3D) have placed them within reach of libraries, archives, and museums (LAM). Major collecting institutions are now exploring how 3D technologies can broaden access to their collections (Ioannides & Quak, 2014; Metallo & Rossi, 2011; Neely & Langer, 2013; Trendler & Street, 2014). Within the next five to ten years, it is expected that costs will decrease as quality increases, making these technologies even more broadly available (Basiliere et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2015a, 2015b). As 3D digitization tools move from the research lab and into mainstream use, the LAM community is confronted with new challenges about how to best invest limited resources (Metallo & Rossi, 2011; Santos et al., 2014). This paper presents the results of early research to identify and track the diffusion of 3D technologies into the scientific and cultural heritage sector. The paper will present the preliminary results from the Collections Cubed Survey conducted from August to October 2015. This survey suggests that while 3D technologies have reached an inflection point in terms of availability and accessibility, libraries, archives, and museums are just beginning to understand the opportunities they offer. As with the emergence of other new technologies, LAM professionals are working to meet the challenges presented by quickly evolving hardware and software, lack of best practices, and a shortage of trained staff. Yet the opportunities to document collections for research, exhibition, and outreach are driving the exploration of these new technologies."

The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision has long been a front runner when it comes to supporting open standards and free re-use of our collections. Surprisingly enough, we never tried it the other way around: using open content to create an exhibit. So when we started to develop an exhibition celebrating the 50th anniversary of 3FM - one of Holland's main public pop radio channels - we asked ourselves: would we be able to create a personalized, interactive videomapping exhibit using mainly open content? During a How-To-Session Karen Drost and Maarten Brinkerink will dive into how we managed this, and share what we learned."

This mandate resulted in a variety of designs and intentions that ultimately required development and implementation strategies to provide access to content through a universal keypad (for screen and audio controls); a mobile application using low-energy Bluetooth beacons; and content available in two languages, two forms of sign language, two descriptive audio tracks, and two sets of captioning. This complex set of variables was difficult to balance, and the authors discuss the implementation strategy and production and development scenarios encountered by trying to execute the greatest of ambitions."

HyperStudio, MIT's digital humanities laboratory, has been tackling this question through the development of Artbot, a mobile website that encourages meaningful, sustained relationships to art museums in the Boston area. Artbot combines two strategies to enable users to discover cultural happenings in the city: a serendipitous approach that allows users to explore via linkages between art events, and a recommendation system that suggests events based on a user's interests. Using Artbot as its primary case study, this paper will examine the design and building of art discovery systems. First, it will survey other examples of art recommendation and discovery systems, such as Magic Tate Ball, Serendip-o-matic, Artsy, and the Powerhouse's OPAC 2.0 collection project. Then we will discuss the front-end design and back-end technologies behind Artbot's discovery engine and consider how other cultural institutions can implement these approaches."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "In 2012 the Australian National Museum led a project called Urban Farming and the Agricultural Show which explored how agricultural shows, helped to shape understandings of the relationships between food, people and place. At the same time (2013) they released Food Stories, a program of digital content creation and publication which allowed audiences to share their food stories. Both initiatives represented a relatively traditional approach to the interpretation of food production and culinary heritage. The introduction of 3D food printing brings another dimension to the curatorial and outreach endeavour. A 3D food printer is a special 3D printing system which enables the construction of parts using edible materials mainly from viscous materials (e.g. cheese, paté, dough, chocolate) and powdered substances (e.g. sugar). In this paper we explore how a museum can be used as a laboratory for engaging audiences in new food production and resultant interpretations of culinary heritage. A traditional cuisine is a rich source of creativity, as evidenced through the recent 3D food printing projects. See ChefJet, Foodini, Bocusini, Pancake Bot, Barilla's 3D pasta printer at EXPO 2015 and many other initiatives. However, 3D food printing in a museum context has yet to be explored. Additionally, the potential of 3D food printing for the creative reinterpretation of culinary heritage is discussed in a context of burgeoning makerspaces, many of which are located in community spaces and equipped with rudimentary digital fabrication facilities. We underpin our paper by considering the opportunities afforded museums to act as creative laboratories, providing makerspaces which engage audiences in digital fabrication with access to significantly more expensive highly specialised equipment such as 3D food printers. This premise is supported by cases from NEW INC, the New Museum (NY) museum-led incubator which demonstrate the potential for museums to act as laboratories."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "During its current closure, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) has the unique opportunity to engage in a prolonged period of self-examination and experimentation. In this sprit, SFMOMA is developing an API for its permanent collection. Before SFMOMA releases its Collection API to the public, the museum will be the primary user, with the intent to develop a deep understanding of the API's possibilities and applications for both internal and public use. The questions we ask about the collection provide the guiding principles for development and design of the API. In collaboration with Stamen Design, SFMOMA organized an Art + Data Day to bring together some of the Bay Area's most innovative creative technologists to ask probing questions about the museum's collection using the new API. By the end of the day, we hoped to produce some amazing outcomes, and we were open to what they might be—an application? A data visualization? A story? A roadmap to even more robust data for the API? Or perhaps designs for something grander. This event was structured as an un-hackathon, a format inspired by participatory design approaches to creatively develop technology and a rejection of high-pressure, end-product-focused hackathon practices that reward speedy coding over effective problem solving. Rather than racing to complete or compete, the un-hackathon was about collaboration, brainstorming, and better understanding how the API will be used. Aside from an unabashed excuse to geek out and create beautiful data visualizations and nerdy software, Art + Data Day was a meaningful opportunity for SFMOMA to better understand how its API will be used and how it can be improved. Written in collaboration with Beth Schechter of Stamen Design, this paper deep dives into the Art + Data Day findings, emphasizing how they inform digital storytelling, potential gaming opportunities, and innovative on-site digital experiences at SFMOMA, and presents the SFMOMA API."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Cooper Hewitt reopened at the end of 2014 with a transformed museum in a renovated heritage building, Andrew Carnegie's home on the Upper East Side of New York City. New galleries, a collection that was being rapidly digitized, a new brand, and a desire for new audiences drove the museum to rethink and reposition its role as a design museum. At the core of the new museum is a digital platform, built in-house, that connects collection and patron management systems to in-gallery and online experiences. These have allowed the museum to redesign everything from object labels and showcases to the fundamentals of a 'visit experience'. This paper explores in detail the process, the decisions made – and resulting tradeoffs - during each stage of the process. In so doing it reveals the challenges of collaborating with internal and external capacities; operating internationally with online collaboration tools; rapid prototyping; and the distinct differences between software and hardware design and production."

    "abstract": "Staff members from the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) and the Phillips Collection address the challenges, successes, surprises, and triumphs of digital in-gallery experiences by sharing the implementation of the same digital self-portrait app for two Neo-Impressionism exhibitions. The authors seek to provide approaches to the challenge of introducing technology in art museum galleries. The discussion furnishes real-world examples of how a museum, regardless of size or available resources, can experiment with engaging its visitors through emerging and well-explored technologies. The progressive integration of technology in the galleries at the IMA is the result of the implementation of a new visitor-centered exhibition-development model that has been in place for over a year with the support of the upper management (top-down model). At the core of this new approach, whose objective is to increase visitors' engagement with art, is the key role that interpretation specialists and evaluators play in the exhibition-development process. The integration of these staff into a team-based method for development has resulted in a more consistent and strategic use of technology-based interpretive tools, demonstrated most recently in an in-gallery app, Pointillize Yourself. The Phillips Collection, lacking resources and experience with large-scale projects, implemented a grassroots, bottom-up model. First, the Phillips tested small, one-off, in-gallery activities at public programs to gauge audience interest and staff capacity. Then, building on successes and learning from experiences, they implemented larger and longer-term projects. Throughout the process, informal evaluation and user testing provided important feedback for development. Meanwhile, internal shifts in mission and goals refined interdepartmental working groups. These experiments with technology culminated in the implementation of the #NeoImpressed app, a modified version of IMA's Pointillize Yourself."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Heritage organisations have embraced the use of crowdsourcing in recent years, and the Museum of London has experimented with using this model specifically with a schools' audience. Two departments (Information Resources and Learning) piloted the \"Tag London\" project, each hoping to meet some discrete needs: to improve online collections data and engage a large number of schoolchildren. The museum was attracted to the idea of a project in which participants actively engaged with museum objects whilst also helping improve data. The result was a website that invited eight- to fourteen-year-old children to categorise a selection of museum objects by object type and time period. The initial pilot with some three hundred students produced valuable and encouraging insights. A subsequent consultation with a much broader sample of teachers went on to highlight potential flaws with the project. As a result of a clear disconnect between the museum's and teachers' expectations, which saw teachers reporting a need for adjustments to the product that would have worked against the fundamental principle of crowdsourcing, the museum was required to reflect on what constitutes an acceptable level of compromise in a project intended to benefit all parties. This paper explores the role of choice in participation (were the school students more digital conscripts than digital volunteers?) and the importance of the teacher as gatekeeper. Tag London suggests assumptions made about one crowdsourcing approach cannot necessarily be applied to another and reflects on the use of crowdsourcing in a formal learning environment. The museum ultimately decided to pause its use of Tag London with schools, and this paper details what informed this decision."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Museums are increasingly researching new ways to tell stories, engage, entertain, and educate a heterogeneous group of visitors. In particular, the rapid rise of mobile devices suggests new possibilities for museums, but it also raises new issues. On one hand, mobile devices are personal, portable, and often available since the majority of visitors carry their own devices within the museum. On the other hand, mobile devices can disrupt the visit, limiting both social and physical interaction with other visitors and artifacts. Above all, visitors need to hold the devices in their hands, which can be tiring and limit the possibilities for other hands-on activities. Wearable devices such as headsets can mitigate this problem. Indeed, they have such potential that they have already made their way into museums: they are personal, portable, follow the visitor through the museum experience, and don't need to be held. This paper proposes a wearable augmented-reality (AR) headset aimed at enriching the museum experience. The headset consists of a lightweight transparent frame that holds the smartphone on the top instead of in front of the user's eyes. Since visitors will use their own mobile devices, the purchase and maintenance costs for the museum will be limited. A visitor will simply need to download an application and put her smartphone on the top of the headset frame. Content from the device's screen will be projected on a transparent surface in front of the visitor's eyes. This paper will describe the development of the wearable device, as well as its potential applications in supporting and augmenting a museum visit."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Many cultural institutions (CIs) have redefined their role in society in order to become meaningful for their communities. Particularly in museums, conversations around artifacts hold the potential to enhance interpretation and provoke the production of meaningful insights. However, there are challenges when institutions grant visitors permission to contribute. One of the main problems concerns the lack of strategies to profit from visitors' insights. Museum kiosks are usually for browsing and searching, and popular social-media websites do not offer ways to store, analyze, and build upon the content produced on those environments. This paper presents the conceptual and technical designs of an experimental platform aimed at assisting interpretation and generating content. The platform, currently in the prototype phase, will serve both institutions and affiliated communities by attempting to improve the quality of outcomes in the context of CIs' knowledge assets. The platform is based on two strategies: easy creation of structured data, and recommendations. Structured data can be used in combination with machine-learning algorithms in order to offer meaningful recommendations. In addition, curatorial research can also be assisted since the application provides an easy-to-use interface for organizing content through Knowledge Maps, which are used for feeding the recommendation system with content from other museum professionals and visitors' insights."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Museums, and many other organizations, tend to approach digital projects from the perspective of individual channels. They propose an app, a website, an interactive. This makes sense for organizations. However, visitors don't think in channels. Visitors expect a single, unified experience across all of their interactions. Visitors don't even distinguish physical and digital experiences, to them it is all one experience, and they expect that to flow seamlessly from one to the other. They buy their tickets in one channel and pick up in another. They indicate interests in one channel, such as website, and expect that to carry through to other channels, such as an app. This expectation requires Museums to think differently when initiating digital projects. It requires Museums to think about the larger ecosystem that these digital initiatives exist in. This paper proposes how to bring this thinking to Museums as new digital projects are initiated, with practical examples of how to apply this thinking."

    "abstract": "In 2014 at the Museums and the Web conferences in Baltimore, Maryland, and Florence, Italy, we presented our report on how two thousand museums were relating on Twitter. After our presentation, we decided to continue our investigation in two directions: The first are the case studies. We wanted to analyze some museums' Twitter environments: how museums are relating to their followers, how they form different communities defined by underlying relationships, the growth of the network around a museum, detection of influencers, etc. We also wanted to study how to use this information in order to design better social-media strategies for an improved and more realistic assessment of the work and actions' results on Twitter. Our case studies are London's Victoria & Albert, Turin's Palazzo Madama, and Barcelona's Center for Contemporary Culture. We have chosen museums with different Twitter strategies, countries, languages, and follower bases ranging from 7,000 at the time of writing this abstract (Palazzo Madama) to the 450,000 from V&A. The goal is to have different situations represented and run a useful research for museums of different sizes. The second direction is how museum professionals are interacting with each other on Twitter thanks to the use of hashtags, like #musetech, in order to share information, questions, and experiences."

    "abstract": "The designers of mobile museum guides are increasingly interested in facilitating rich interpretations of a collection's exhibits that can be personalised to meet the needs of a diverse range of individual visitors. It is commonplace to visit these settings in small groups, with friends or family. This sociality of a visit can significantly affect how visitors experience museums and their objects, but current guides can inhibit group interaction, especially when the focus is on personalisation towards individuals. Our design approach embeds sociality from the beginning, treating personalisation as a social rather than computational issue, an idea that has potential reach beyond our own project. We describe our design of an interactive visiting experience that lets visitors create interpretations of exhibits for their friends and loved ones that they then experience together, letting them scaffold a visiting experience by setting up prompts, information, and emotive triggers around individual exhibits. The result is a personalised, one-off mobile tour crafted by the visitors themselves to directly communicate interpretations to others that they know well. We present the results of two pilot studies in which this approach was used in different museum settings and with different types of small groups. We report on how visitors designed highly personal experiences for one another, analysing how groups of visitors negotiated these experiences together in the museum visit, and revealing how this type of self-design framework for engaging audiences in a socially coherent way leads to rich, stimulating visits for the whole group and each individual member. We present a replicable design for engaging audiences, increasing visitor participation, and realising the potential for meaningful group experiences."

    "abstract": "The New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC) involves the research libraries of the Brooklyn Museum, Frick, and MoMA. Together with the Pratt Institute, the Brooklyn Museum and then NYARC have undertaken partnership projects to implement digitization of collections in a museum-education setting. This paper explores challenges including integrating digital information within the physical museum and on the Web, recognizing the crucial role this plays in user engagement. Education is a key aspect, and information on a new master program to support professionals in the interdisciplinary skills needed is also presented. Leading museums realize the importance of an integrated digital approach. The Cooper Hewitt Museum's newly redeveloped display is presented as a model example. Educational underpinning and inventive use of digital technology, with regard for social and cultural issues, are key aspects for success."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "In this paper, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF) and Earprint Productions discuss how a mobile app that enhances visitor learning and engagement in a museum setting—Voices:FAMSF—can also position visitors as co-creators of their museum experiences. It shows how the app correlates—in design, content, and functionality—with trending museum educational practices that give visitors agency over, and a voice in, their learning in a museum setting. Thus, visitors are able to choose how, when, and where they will experience educational content and participate in the interpretive process. The paper also discusses why FAMSF chose an open-source framework to build Voices:FAMSF, and how museums benefit from open-source development. FAMSF came to Earprint Productions with a challenge: use mobile technology in new ways to enhance, rather than detract from, the very experience of being in the presence of great art. The solution Earprint and the Museums arrived at is an immersive soundscape app, Voices:FAMSF, that interprets key outdoor sculptures and architecture at both the de Young and the Legion of Honor. The app is location sensitive (audio content is driven by the viewer's location via GPS), customizable (viewers choose to hear their own “mix” of museum voices, community voices, or both), and participatory (it allows visitors to co-create content by recording comments in response to museum-curated prompts)."

    "abstract": "Hackathons, startup incubators, maker spaces, and innovation labs: these terms are common to the world of tech, but they have recently appeared on museum websites and in press releases. The last few years have witnessed a wave of art museum initiatives that invite audiences—from casual visitors to professional artists and technologists—to take the reigns of creative production through experimentation with digital media and fabrication technologies. Where is this interest in engaging audiences with hands-on, technological creation coming from? And how are museums, which might lack the necessary funding and technical know-how to work with new technologies, able to make these initiatives happen? This presentation is informed by the extensive historical and ethnographic research I have conducted for my master's thesis in comparative media studies at MIT. Case studies include the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Art + Technology Lab, a program that awards artist grants and mentorship from individuals and technology companies such as Google, DAQRI, and the Jet Propulson Lab to develop art projects and artistic research; the Peabody Essex Museum's Maker Lounge, an in-gallery space in which visitors are invited to tinker with high and low technologies; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Media Lab, a section of the Digital Media department that invites both visitors and artists to experiment with new technologies through programs such as three-dimensional printing workshops and hackathons."

    "abstract": "August 2014 marked one hundred years since the outbreak of World War I, a highly significant watershed. Melbourne, as temporary national capital, was the centre of Australian wartime operations, and thousands of Victorians lost their lives or were damaged by the conflict. We created an integrated mobile experience that offered visitors a complimentary layer of content in addition to what is physically available throughout the gallery and museum. The mobile experience included off-site modes with content that visitors could engage with before and after a visit to the museum. When using the app, visitors selected one of eight characters to frame their journey throughout the exhibition. Utilising beacon technology as triggers (over thirty), the app delivered relevant content to visitors' mobile devices based on their proximity to a specific gallery zone and the chosen characters. This presentation explores the development of the app and its integrated role in the overall exhibition experience. This is the first time that Museum Victoria has relied on mobile technology to such an extent; this is our first truly integrated app/exhibition experience. We worked with Art Processors to develop a unique app and experience; the exhibition opened on August 30, 2014."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "How can we recognise place as it functions in the digital space, and what does it mean for museum engagement? The digital sector has seen an explosion in locational technology, mapping applications, and social-media platforms capturing and sharing interactions with places. Attachment to place has been explored in sociology and cultural studies for decades and is recognised as a key part of identity creation. As digital communities based on place connections emerge across the Web, what is the place of the museum within these conversations? This paper finds that place plays a key part in individual and community identity within digital culture. What place does the museum occupy within this context? Due to transient and amorphous digital communities, competing with the task of identifying and connecting to an audience is increasingly challenging. The strengthening of place attachment can be seen as a key strategy in supporting the collective identity of a visiting community. Equally, with social-media programs and digitised collections, museums are able to create and connect to multiple communities in dispersed locations. Place remains a potent force for museum engagement as well, as a number of recent initiatives that position the museum at the centre of a place-based community demonstrate. With a focus on digitised collections, the paper also identifies the potential to make multiple and dispersed connections based on place. The inclusion of location in collection management approaches, walks, storytelling, and memory projects, are identified as mechanisms that link place connections back to the museum."

    "abstract": "Victorian Collections is an online collection management system, collection documentation training program and support service, that is provided free of charge for use by community-based collecting organisations across the state of Victoria in Australia. Funded by the Victorian State Government and launched in 2010, Victorian Collections has enabled volunteers and staff from hundreds of community organisations to begin the process of documenting and digitising their collection information. Victorian Collections serves the community museum sector but has also helped to steer non-museum organisations such as veterans groups and religious organisations towards focusing on their heritage collections. Now in its fifth year, almost 60,000 collection records from a wide variety of small to medium-sized organisations are publicly accessible from the Victorian Collections website. That list grows daily. The Victorian Collections project has brought rapid and substantial digital transformation to hundreds small community organisations that previously had little capacity for online engagement beyond participation on social media. With some now beginning to experiment with related technologies such as mobile in-gallery experiences, we can now say that digital transformation is occurring across every tier of the Victorian heritage sector - from small town historical societies right up to the capital city galleries. It's not just for the big guys any more! Following on from the paper \"Victorian Collections: Measuring the Impact of a Digital Community Museum Project\", presented by Forbes Hawkins at MWA2013 in Hong Kong, this new presentation will examine how digital transformation is altering the practise and radically shifting the outlook for a substantial portion of community-based collections organisations within Victoria."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Discover the Queenslander is an online interface to a collection of around 1,000 digitised pages and covers from The Queenslander, a magazine supplement for the Brisbane Courier (1899-1939). Developed by the authors and commissioned by the State Library of Queensland, this interface features a range of rich approaches to representing, navigating, curating and sharing the collection. In particular the interface treats colour as a tool for exploration, revealing the distinctive colours of the collection as well as relationships between colour and time, creator, and other features. Colour is shown to be a compelling form of metadata that can be employed in unique representations of a collection and as an effective component of navigation and curation. Colour metadata is emerging as a feature of online digital collections, including the Cooper Hewitt Museum, Rijksmuseum, Dallas Museum of Art, and V&A, as well as image services such as Flickr and iStockPhoto. Through a comparative analysis of these approaches and our own work on Discover the Queenslander, we outline some of the challenges and opportunities for the use of colour metadata in digital collections. A key question is the role of colour in representing visual collections. In addition to documenting important practical and technical concerns, we reflect on critical issues that arise in working with digital cultural collections, such as the assumptions and biases built into algorithms, and the authorial agency that is exercised in aggregating and synthesising data of any kind. While these issues are not confined to working with colour metadata, colour provides an engaging way to make these concerns visible."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "The Carnegie Museum of Art is attempting to structure provenance data so curators, scholars, and software developers can create visualizations that answer questions that would be difficult or impossible to answer without computer assistance. Provenance, the written description of the history of ownership and custody of art, is typically written as a list of the periods, places, and owners of an artwork. It captures the current best understanding of this history in a succinct and precise manner, and illustrates the gaps and uncertainties that still remain. Provenance is typically written as semi-structured text, following an institution-defined format. It would be useful to have a structured, computer-readable format for this data, allowing for search, visualization, and aggregated research. The American Alliance of Museums suggested standard, widely used across museums, is not defined with enough specificity to allow automated extraction of the structured data contained within provenance texts. Also, the provenance record model in collection management systems (CMS) is often not designed for structured data or does not provide a way to verify that the provenance text matches the structured data. A comprehensive text-based provenance standard, paired with a software library that can parse records written using this standard and convert them into structured data, would allow existing workflows to remain in place while allowing structured data to be automatically extracted from provenance records. The records could continue to be stored within existing CMS databases but contain machine-readable data for use in research and visualization. Outside of data itself, the stories these objects hold are often moving and sometimes astonishing. This ability to ask impossible questions and receive answers previously inaccessible across a museum's collection and (eventually) across many museums' collections is a resource art historians and scholars will find extremely valuable."

    "abstract": "As smartphones have become more advanced and more prevalent in our society, the possible applications for these devices have increased exponentially. These new applications are often all about context and providing that to the user. The Global Positioning System (GPS) has allowed location context to be established when a user has access to the sky. While this method of gathering location information is suitable for outdoor environments, indoor-location awareness has taken a longer road to maturation. From Wi-Fi implementations to Visible Light Communications (VLC) to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), technology is starting to become cost-effective and robust enough to handle indoor-location applications. The Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA), with support from the Institute of Museums and Library Services (IMLS), is undertaking a research project to evaluate the capabilities of BLE for providing location context indoors. The IMA is investigating the feasibility of two applications for indoor-location awareness, providing the user with contextually aware data, and providing the museum with analytics about the user."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "In this session and paper, we consider the changing role of the digital department and the new challenges and opportunities it raises. We discuss how the digital team at National Museum Wales and others have approached this challenge through a variety of different tactics. We share some outcomes and provide tips and suggestions applicable to organisations going through similar transformations. It is increasingly unsustainable, particularly in medium to large organisations, for digital departments alone to deliver all of the organisation's digital programme. We are seeing a shift to a more distributed model in which other departments are taking on more responsibility for digital delivery in their areas. Some questions this raises include: - What is digital leadership in museums? Who are the digital leaders and mentors? - How do cultural organisations develop the digital skills necessary with staff so that they are equipped to deliver their digital aspirations? - How do digital teams introduce new project-management methodologies that are often not aligned with the pace and approach of other museum work? - What is the changing role of the digital department? What new skills do staff need to develop so that they can work effectively with the rest of the organisation? - What new relationships do digital teams need to form in order to support skills development and formalise organisational expectations around digital skills and knowledge? We address these questions through real-life examples from teams in organisations that are finding solutions to these challenges. For example, we use case studies from National Museum Wales that include a new approach to a website redesign, introduction of digital competencies for all staff, and reshaping the digital team from being a production bottleneck to being leaders and facilitators for digital work."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Archival material often provides the context required by curators, researchers, and other users working with material objects, contributing to new narratives and richer understanding. Artefacts and archives are already linked physically in exhibition spaces and intellectually in catalogues, books, and articles. Yet when it comes to collection management, many institutions keep artefacts and archives physically, conceptually, and organisationally separate. For museums, this leads to an over-reliance on implicit knowledge; and for online users it means expansive digital collections are often presented decontextualised. In this paper, the author will examine the recent history and current status of intersecting artefacts and archives in museums—on the Web and in supporting systems—drawing on institutional and project-based examples from Australia and internationally. Through a better understanding of the intersection of these collections and the systems and data structures used to manage them, we can lay the foundations for future developments that will both maintain necessary distinctions in museum and archival practice and create new ways of digitally capturing, managing, and disseminating interconnected collection knowledge within and beyond our institutions."

    "abstract": "While it is critical to talk to visitors about their experiences, getting constructive feedback on digital interactives is not as simple as just asking. When visitors encounter usability issues, they may know that they are confused, but not why or what to do about it. In this how-to session, you'll learn observational and interviewing techniques that go beyond what visitors can tell you to reveal what they know, how they think, and what they need. We'll begin by describing common sources of frustration in digital experiences, such as lack of clarity about purpose, difficulty navigating available options, ambiguous language, and challenges with physical manipulation. We'll use real-life examples from museums and other institutions to illustrate these difficulties and how the causes of the problems may not be evident by only watching visitors or asking them questions. Next, we'll demonstrate a series of techniques for observing and interviewing users that enable you to diagnose the underlying causes of their difficulties. Hypothesis testing, just-in-time probing, echoing and progressive disclosure and other approaches can unlock the underlying causes of usability issues. Visitors come in all kinds, so we'll also share tips for drawing out people who are shy, focusing participants who stray off track, and gathering constructive criticism from those who are overly eager to please. You'll leave the session excited to gather feedback from your visitors and armed with new skills to do so!"

As hand-written documents they are hard to read, and they are often uncatalogued. This means that neither their contents nor their very existence is searchable. In this paper, we will explore the evolving field of online transcription, with a particular emphasis on archival field diaries.

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Presenting a computer in an exhibition while precluding the involvement of a participant really isn't representative of what is important about that piece of culture. After all, it is not simply the hardware in isolation that made a device like the Macintosh memorable; it was the introduction of the mouse in conjunction with a new graphical user interface and software designed for that interface that made it stand apart. In response to this shortcoming in the presentation of computing technology, an exhibition entitled \"The Interface Experience: Forty Years of Personal Computing\" is being planned. This exhibition will consider how the experience of interface can be recreated in an exhibition in a way that shows the interplay between user, hardware, and software, and puts on display the way we perceive, think about, and even desire this category of objects. To accomplish this, the computers must be displayed, thought about, and used within the exhibition as platforms for dynamic interactive experiences. This is really what the experience of these objects is about in our daily life, and presentation of them as static hunks of plastic, silicon, and metal is an incomplete and ultimately irrelevant approach to signaling their relative importance to human culture. In response to these concerns, this two-part submission to the MWX strand of Museums and the Web 2015 entails both a paper on the nature of displaying computing devices in exhibitions and a demonstration of software designed as didactic scripts to be interacted with by visitors on original hardware in the exhibition. The five devices for which scripts are being designed are the Commodore 64, Apple Macintosh Plus, PalmPilot Professional, Apple iPad 2, and Microsoft Kinect. The paper will elucidate the questions and challenges posed above, while the software demonstration will put on display some of the solutions that will have been arrived at by the opening of the exhibition in late March."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Museums have traditionally attempted to engage virtually with students and teachers through the use of video or Web-based conferencing services. These programs typically emulate an on-site single or multiple field-trip experience. They are often synchronous, with a museum facilitator on one end and learners at the other. However, museums have the opportunity to be front and center in reaching students in ways that go far beyond the traditional virtual field-trip and Web-based activities. In an effort to increase its reach, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art has developed a for-credit online course for high school students. The course, \"Museum Mash Up: American Identity Through the Arts,\" explores American history through the visual arts. As students progress through the course, they learn about the curatorial, creative, and educational processes necessary to develop an exhibition. The course culminates with a student-curated exhibition in a virtual gallery space developed in the Unity Game Engine. Designed by the Tesseract Studio for Game Design and Immersive Environments at the University of Arkansas, the gallery is a virtual replication of the architecture of Crystal Bridges' 20th Century Gallery. Unity is a next-generation game engine widely used in independent game development and visualization applications in engineering, architecture, and medicine. It allows for accurate representation of terrain and structures while providing sophisticated control over textures and lighting. Because Unity publishes to the Web and mobile devices, it has tremendous potential for immersive, interactive museum applications and distance education. This demonstration will highlight unique aspects of the course and provide insights into the potential and pitfalls of developing a museum-based online course and increasing scale."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "The digital/Web team of an institution can no longer be solely responsible for a truly dynamic museum website. In the museum field today, this is not a radical statement. As Tate has declared, museums are working towards a model of “Digital as a Dimension of Everything.” In smaller institutions with limited staff, this trend increases the challenge of both content creation and management. In the effort to provide visitors and researchers access to more engaging content and collections online, museums need to take responsibility for formalizing and strengthening their staff's digital skillsets. In 2011, the Corning Museum of Glass (CMoG) implemented a museum-wide Power User group that, with varying levels of responsibility, actively maintains, updates, and populates website content in the Drupal CMS. With the formation of a new digital media department in 2014, CMoG has evaluated the successes and challenges of the Power Users over the past three years. This paper will address how an institution's digital strategy can be put to practice in the day-to-day work (and formal job descriptions) of staff from every department and skill level, highlighting important factors to a successful distributed Web-content management process. Key points and recommendations for museums with limited staff or that are looking to decentralize digital content management include how blogging and social media can act as a gateway to digital literacy, the critical nature of top leadership support, and how establishing a Power User group is part of the larger task of establishing a more tech/Web/digitally literate staff throughout a museum."

    "abstract": "Social media enables possibilities for museums to engage with ideas and with audiences who want to participate, who can generate content, and who would like to create a community (Boches, 2013). This is a challenging space. But worth exploring and unpacking further. In this paper we offer the chance to discuss what social media can bring to the museum space, but particularly the museum education space. We share innovative practices in the Australian context that demonstrates what is possible. Focus is on connecting teachers and the museum using social media to begin, continue, and extend connections and conversations. The focus of the paper will be to share a variety of case studies. We discuss the development of an accredited teacher education subject located within a postgraduate degree at La Trobe University and delivered in partnership with Museum Victoria and National Gallery of Victoria. This subject integrates a variety of social media platforms to engage future teachers with cultural organisations as resources for learning. This case is then juxtaposed with how Museum Victoria is utilising social media with teachers. Specifically we share the Twitter profile of @MVTeachers and the development of ongoing connections to the Museum's humanities and sciences education programs and resources through #TwitterTours. A community of learners underpinned by building and supporting relationships, making new connections, sharing and modeling, and connecting future ways of working is demonstrated in all these cases. Central is the engagement with museums, collective and multiple voices as well as technology. This is modeling the future of learning in cultural organisations. This way of working focuses on participatory cultural communication (Russo et al., 2008; Simon, 2010) and enables a social constructive approach to communication. Most importantly access, contribution and learning is contemporary and future proofed."

    "abstract": "Studies show that online museum collections are among the least popular features of a museum website, which many museums attribute to a lack of interest. While it's certainly possible that a large segment of the population is simply uninterested in viewing museum objects through a computer screen, it is also possible that a large number of people want to find and view museum objects digitally but have been discouraged from doing so due to the poor user experience (UX) of existing online-collection interfaces. This paper describes the creation and validation of a UX assessment rubric for online museum collections. Consisting of ten factors, the rubric was developed iteratively through in-depth examinations of several existing museum-collection interfaces. To validate the rubric and test its reliability and utility, an experiment was conducted in which two UX professionals and two museum professionals were asked to apply the rubric to three online museum collections and then provide their feedback on the rubric and its use as an assessment tool. This paper presents the results of this validation study, as well as museum-specific results derived from applying the rubric. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the rubric may be used to improve the UX of museum-collection interfaces and future research directions aimed at strengthening and refining the rubric for use by museum professionals."

    "abstract": "In September 2013, the Metropolitan Museum of Art launched a new audio guide. This presented an opportunity—and a need—to take a more strategic look at this long-standing service. Although the Museum has provided an audio-guide service for more than fifty years, thus far it has had a limited understanding of who uses the service and what kind of impact it might have. Who is the audio guide serving? What is and is not working? In an effort to answer these questions, the Museum conducted an evaluation of its new audio guide in collaboration with Frankly, Green + Webb. We took a comprehensive look at the service, seeking to understand the entire visitor journey from initial awareness to the effect of the guide on the overall museum experience. This service design approach—though well established in the commercial sector (Polaine, Løvlie, & Reason, 2013)—is relatively new in the museum field. Our paper includes findings from the evaluation and insights we gained from the research process, as well as how these insights are applicable to the wider museum field. What can other museums learn from our experience? What is the value of evaluating an audio guide as a service rather than a product? How can museums move from evaluation data to insights and actionable recommendations? And perhaps most challenging: how can we design successful digital products and services in complex organizations with multiple stakeholders who have different levels of comfort with innovation and risk? These issues are not unique to the audio-guide service or to the Met; they are common to digital projects across all museums."

    "abstract": "It is a transitional moment for one of the British Museum's flagship products: the permanent collection audio guide. Nearly 160,000 visitors take the guide each year. It provides multimedia commentaries for 220 objects on display in museum galleries. In late 2014, the Museum embarked on a project to redesign the guide. This coincided with the launch of a new digital strategy focused on user-centred design. In a six-week Agile project, a cross-disciplinary team interviewed, observed, and tested paper prototypes with more than 250 visitors. This paper highlights the results, which include six key factors that influence take-up rate of audio guides and common patterns of behaviour in their use. It is of interest to anyone reflecting on the role of the traditional audio or multimedia guide alongside smartphones and mobile apps."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "How can museums implement digital methodology from the start of a project to its end? All too often, we graft digital assets or tools onto the ends of projects rather than letting them play an integral role in our planning from the beginning. This digitally exclusive approach frequently results in what Koven J. Smith calls \"analogue products with a digital finish\" (Smith, 2014a). In the fall of 2013, the Web team at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) launched a cross-departmental collaboration to create an iPad-based interactive digital map for an exhibition on Beijing's Forbidden City. This public-facing instance of mapping heralded a more widespread use of open-source digital-mapping tools across the museum. Museum studies students are now using Google Maps Engine to display their research in our galleries, collections managers are taking a geographical approach to organize their discoveries, and the Web team is holding well-attended all-staff workshops to teach the basics of online mapping. This paper proposes that staff enthusiasm for mapping technology at the ROM is directly related to the familiarity of the tools being implemented. It outlines the process by which staff across the museum integrate digital mapping into their day-to-day workflows and suggests a model for digital inclusivity for future projects. When digital tools play an integral role in the research and planning stages of an exhibition or public-facing project, what we display to our online and on-site visitors becomes a more authentically digital and more fundamentally usable experience."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Museums have long identified teachers and their students as primary audiences. Through object loans, lesson plans, and more recently digital resources, our institutions have recognized the potential for the narratives told through exhibitions to reach students outside the museum walls. Many of these traditional models no longer reflect the realities of the contemporary classroom, one being rapidly transformed by budget shortcomings, evolving teaching standards, and the potential of new technologies. Museums are uniquely positioned to play a greater role in formal education. In order to meet this potential, museums can benefit from understanding the needs of these audiences and the capabilities of their institutions to meet them. Since 2010, the Smithsonian, through its Center for Learning and Digital Access, has conducted a series of research projects to better understand how teachers and their students use museum learning resources. This formal paper will share the results of the following five independent, yet progressional, studies and offer usable best practices garnered from a meta-analysis of their results combined with other recent literature in this field: 1. Remedial Evaluation of the Materials Distributed at the Smithsonian Institution's Annual Teachers' Night (2010) 2. Capturing the Voice of Customer, a Satisfaction Insight Review of SmithsonianEducation.org (2011) 3. Digital Learning Resources Project (2012) 4. Increasing the Discoverability of Smithsonian Digital Resources: Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI) (2014) 5. Piloting Tools to Enable Active and Participatory Learning for Middle School Students: Facilitating Digital Learning with Smithsonian Digital Resources (2014) A meta-summary of these research findings, combined with recent literature, will be shared as a suite of best practices for connecting museum assets with teachers and students."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the recent evolutions in digital cultural mediation for museums. It aims to show the convergence of recent socio-technological trends and their social appropriation by museums towards the building of an “open museum” based on the paradigm of collaboration and open access to culture. In the last fifteen years, museums developed policies to make digital cultural resources available. To facilitate the dissemination and circulation of cultural contents, they adopted the media habits of their audience by relying on electronic artefacts and digital data. They began with local indoor installations, then extended them to websites and social networks and finally went digitally mobile with specific apps. This innovative digital communicational policy blurs boundaries between in-situ physical museums and their digital resources. Museum contents are displayed on external platforms developed by industrial stakeholders whose core business was not initially the cultural field. This new configuration allows individual access to cultural content inside and outside the museum by combining the discovery of physical locations and digital resources. In this perspective, we investigated cultural Linked Open Data, in particular the opportunities offered by the social construction of an inter-museum cultural space leading to free circulation of knowledge. We showed that the notion of museum is being extended to include digital social networks, digital mobility and cultural Linked Open Data. This conception of a museum extending beyond its physical space to digital spaces is what could be called an \"open museum.\" Our approach is based on three studies: a) a qualitative analysis of a corpus of professional publications by American and European museums during years 2012-2014; b) five case studies based on interviews with professionals from five American museums; c) one specific example, “Musée d'Histoire de Marseille” in France, in which one of the authors was involved."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "In 2013, the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) received a generous grant to reinvent its approach to online collections. While many museums provide online access to their collections and many digitization projects are currently underway, the DMA sought to unify the content-production processes of object digitization with the publishing and aggregation of collections content to the Web. In this paper, the authors will propose a new digital framework for online collections that integrates digitization workflows, internal content-harvesting strategies from multiple internal repositories, and the creation of in-house crowdsourcing tools for rapid image and metadata management. By integrating process analytics with the framework from the beginning, the tools facilitate the ability to monitor workflows and allow staff to explore the collection as a whole. In the future, this approach will allow the public to explore the collection as a whole and not simply as a series of pages. By leveraging a schemaless underlying data architecture, the framework facilitates the integration of metadata and media assets, as well as the modeling of aggregated external content. This approach allows for a flexibility in data modeling that promises to scale to large numbers of items, but also to other forms of data and object models that are currently unknown. The authors will document a rapid digitization approach that uses the digital collection framework as a key tool in object selection, verification, and enhancement. The process includes a collaborative selection and review with curatorial, collections management, and digital imaging staff."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "In 2011, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York implemented a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solution, Salesforce, to help manage and track its vast member and donor population, past and present. Since its initial implementation, additional data from other Museum systems have been integrated into the CRM platform, such as a member's retail purchase history, e-commerce online activity, and visitation history, thereby enabling the Museum to have a 360-degree view of every Museum member and donor. This view represents a holistic and multichannel perspective of a member's lifetime online and on-site journey through all of the Museum's offerings. This integrated CRM platform has enabled the Museum to provide more-informed customer service, retain and grow its member and donor population, increase engagement with its donors, and enhance its lobby operations through the use of mobile technologies. In the summer of 2014, the Museum launched a new mobile application utilizing the integrated CRM data, with a goal of optimizing the member and visitor experience in the Museum lobby. This application has transformed the operations in the Museum's lobby and beyond, offering new possibilities for membership renewals and conversions. This paper and the subsequent presentation look at the technology and business challenges in implementing an integrated CRM platform. We will look at both the concepts and ideas that led to the Museum's successes, and also those that did not produce the expected results. We will review upcoming plans for further changes to the CRM platform, such as tighter integration with the Museum's MoMA.org website and simplifying the Museum's outreach for traveling exhibitions. Finally, we will describe how the Museum has moved a core operational system from a costly and cumbersome internal application to a scalable cloud-based solution, enabling more agile development and easier integration with current technologies."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "National Services Te Paerangi (NSTP) is New Zealand's museum sector support team, based at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. NSTP works in partnership with museums, galleries and iwi (indigenous tribes), offering a range of practical and strategic programmes aimed at strengthening and building capacity in the museum sector. Our first digital initiative, NZMuseums, gave museums all over New Zealand the ability to have a free web presence, access to a collection management system, and the ability to display even the smallest collection online. Many of the museums NSTP works with are small, volunteer-run organisations with limited budgets, so with the launch of NZMuseums, NSTP was able to meet a number of needs identified by the sector. In an effort to promote collaboration and open data across the sector, NSTP took a further step to help grow online communities. In 2012, the online exhibition Kiwi Chicks: New Zealand Girl History/Ngā Kōhine Kiwi: He Hītori Taitamāhine o Aotearoa was developed in partnership with Girl Museum. Kiwi Chicks is a collections-driven exhibition project that explores girlhood in New Zealand during the 18th-20th centuries. Recently NSTP developed a further collaborative online exhibition project to commemorate the Great War centenary – All That Remains: WWI objects in New Zealand museum collections/He Waihotanga Iho mai i te Pakanga Tuatahi. This project broadens the scope of the original NZMuseums site by creating opportunities for participation by non-traditional museum spaces, for example, by drawing on the collections and knowledge of iwi caring for taonga (treasured things), Returned Services Associations, schools, and more. This presentation covers NSTP's digital engagement, our successes and challenges, and how we have evolved from providing a place for those without the funds for a website to have a virtual presence, to enabling the creation of online exhibition and community projects."

    "abstract": "The modern DSLR camera is an incredible communication tool that combines exceptional image quality and affordability into an unparalleled opportunity. Amateurs and professionals alike are taking advantage of this new visual frontier to create amazing works that promote, inspire, and educate, but many museums are still starved for the visuals they need to connect with audiences. This paper accompanies a hands-on workshop that teaches the skills necessary to capture moments and tell stories that matter to your institution. It consists of three parts—Knowing Your Camera, Digital Photography, and DSLR Filmmaking—designed to give attendees a firm technical foundation in using their camera, and will builds on that foundation with workflows and best practices that cover preparation, production and post, storytelling, and equipment. Highlights include: becoming a visual communicator for your organization; photo versus video?; shoot once, use many; thoughtful composition; make aperture work for you; camera RAW saved my life; know thy camera, know thyself; shot happens; post-production ASAP; enabling your organization's “visual evangelists”; the most important piece of video equipment (is not a camera); and getting off the script. The workshop includes a photo walk during the session to capture images at the venue, and instruction on post-production workflows for photography and video production using Adobe's Creative Suite. Though it is not required to participate, attendees are encouraged to bring their own cameras and laptops to put these lessons into practice as part of the workshop experience."

    "abstract": "As museums refocus themselves as community centers and free-choice learning venues, quality photography becomes a must-have asset for promoting your institution. When the Ohio Historical Society rebranded itself as the Ohio History Connection in 2014, its library of candid, current-event photography became as important as its vast collection of historic images. Department Manager of Multimedia Services Ty Pierce's work behind the lens has helped create a new face for his organization. This paper accompanies his MW2015 how-to session on event photography. Whether you shoot on an iPhone or a DSLR camera, this session teaches how to get in the game and become a visual communicator. While the focus is on candid, event-style photography, its lessons are applicable to other types of photo and video opportunities that museums can leverage to showcase their offerings to the public. Highlights include: becoming a visual communicator for your organization; the components of a great photographer; shoot once, use many; exposure, look, and feel; know thy camera, know thyself; preparing for a visual event; shot happens; post-production ASAP; camera RAW saved my life; and how to enable your “visual evangelists” through social media. The session will end with an open discussion about projects, workflows, equipment, and other ways to promote museums using DIY visual communications."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "The power of oral history lies in its ability to turn an event or topic into a personal experience between two people: the interviewee and the user. Digital oral history collections, however, are usually presented as a long-form video and a separate transcript or index document. This disconnect between the transcript document and the audio/video recording makes for a disjointed and time-consuming user experience, undermining the potential of oral history to connect users with historical narratives. This paper accompanies a how-to session that gives an overview of the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer and the work the Ohio History Connection's Multimedia Services team has done to create a new distribution platform for \"Oral History Interactives.\" It discusses the challenges of producing high-quality oral histories and the additional challenges of producing them as interactives, and gives workflows developed to meet these challenges. This include such topics as on-location scanning, portable studio setups for artifact photography, and efficient ways to collect narrative descriptions to use as metadata."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Projects in museums have and need stakeholders to define and review their requirements and outputs and to deliver successful outcomes. Careful analysis and selection of stakeholders should be carried out referencing the scale and type of project and the culture of the museum in which the project is to be delivered. Key definitions and four tools to facilitate the process of stakeholder engagement and management will be presented. First is the identification and classification of stakeholders as contributors, creators, and consumers to ensure that no one is forgotten. Second, consideration of their likely influence over or interest in the project will start to suggest an approach to their involvement. Third, stakeholders who will influence a project can be divided into groups to be informed, engaged, or consulted. Expectations about the results of the engagement process can be socialised with them, the methods of communicating can be selected for maximum effectiveness, and their agreement can be gained. Finally, classification of the roles for the stakeholders who are part of the project delivery team can be achieved using a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consult, Inform) chart to define overall responsibilities for the creation and signoff of deliverables. The key premise is that clarity about stakeholder roles and responsibilities, with their agreement, at the start of the project will maximise the project's likelihood of success."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Social media and online content play an increasingly important role in the efforts of museums to reach audiences, including online video distributed over sites like YouTube. Taking into account the established goal of museums to educate the public and previous literature on museums' uses of social media, this study investigates how museums currently use YouTube, and whether their strategies are successful in gaining desired viewership numbers. Data collected on a large number of art-museum YouTube accounts establishes trends in video content and reveals which types of videos are more successful than others. The study also evaluates the impact of video-titling practices and presence of celebrities or well-known artists on video view counts. The data suggests that it is common for museums to use YouTube channels for both content-marketing and traditional-marketing purposes, and that content-marketing videos can be categorized as either \"inward looking\"—videos about museum activities and practices—or \"outward looking\"—videos about art, artists, or other educational or entertainment content. Data analysis reveals that \"outward-looking\" content tends to perform better on YouTube, and sheds light on the importance of choosing video titles that are familiar to a general audience in order to gain views. Additionally, many examples of popular non-museum educational YouTube channels were analyzed in order to provide suggested tactics to the museum world. Synthesizing these findings, the author offers possible recommendations for YouTube channel enhancement, including search engine–optimization consciousness, hosting of a channel by a dynamic on-camera personality, and honing of video content to the YouTube audience."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Data is an increasingly important part of how we understand the world around us, but making abstract and complex data sets accessible to museum visitors can pose a significant challenge. The CoCensus exhibit, installed at the New York Hall of Science, seeks to engage visitors in exploring mapped census data and encourage reasoning about the spatial, temporal, and quantitative properties of the data set through a customizable, interactive multiuser exhibit. This paper discusses two major design challenges in creating this novel exhibit, which utilizes embodied interaction to let visitors use their body movements to “play” with digital representations of data in a collaborative learning space. The first challenge was providing an \"entry point\" to engage visitors with the abstract data set, which was accomplished by allowing visitors to select personally relevant subsets of the census data and dynamically control how those subsets were displayed. Using motion-sensing technologies to situate this control in multiple users' bodies through movements and gestures addressed the second challenge of engaging multiple participants, who were now able to coordinate their actions to jointly explore their data. This paper will discuss design iterations of CoCensus to describe how motion-sensing technologies have been harnessed to transform the floor space of an exhibit into an interactive timeline, demonstrating that museums can play a role in helping visitors develop data-reasoning skills, playfully and collaboratively."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "This paper describes how a rare museum collection fueled a broad and diverse partnership and a new entity (the Cultural Technology Development Lab) and showcases some emerging technologies and processes ideally suited to preserving and providing access to fragile three-dimensional (3D) objects in museum collections and cultural heritage sites. The Gustave Baumann marionettes were ideal subjects for interactivity. Because of their fragility, visitors are unlikely to ever see them in motion as they were designed. Being able to embody the models gives new life to these objects while giving visitors a new way of interacting with them in the museum, a space that is often considered hands-off. The process of 3D scanning and modeling opens up a wealth of new opportunities for surfacing all kinds of objects in collections, not limited to marionettes. It can be applied to everything from sculpture and basketry to fossils and natural history specimens. Once the 3D models are available, they can be deployed throughout the institution, behind the scenes for research and conservation, on the exhibit floor, for enhanced visitor engagement and accessibility, and beyond museum walls, for education and outreach."

But how is the museum to author digital storytelling experiences that cater to various needs while maintaining scientific integrity? In this paper, we report on a series of experiences involving the creation of several interactive rich-media museum stories. These digital stories were authored by experts who collaborated in numerous intensive, hands-on participatory design workshops held at high-profile cultural sites: the Acropolis Museum in Greece, the archaeological site of Çatalhöyük in Turkey, and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. We present the story-authoring methodology and discuss the lessons learned regarding collaborative authoring of museum stories. We conclude with the potential impact this authoring process may have at the institutional level."

The authors examine examples of narrative presentations available today in digital and analog media and probe how they use the X- and Y-axes to enable surfing and diving, snacking, and in-depth experience. They examine the virtues and limitations of current ways of communicating and ask what opportunities might remain untapped: fresh ways of matching form to content suited to today's time-starved Web-surfing conditions."

    "abstract": "BYOD, or Bring Your Own Device, is a growing rallying cry in business and educational organizations, encouraging or requiring employees and students to provide their own technology. Museums uniquely have two opportunities to apply this approach: one with their staff and the other with visitors. While much has been written in business regarding the IT strategies, policies, and protocols for BYOD implementation in managing employees' devices, very little formal research exists regarding factors leading to successful BYOD museum-visitor programming. In 2012, the Corning Museum of Glass (CMoG) broke ground for its new North Wing Contemporary galleries. Using the new North Wing as a testing ground, the museum began work on a campus-wide digital media strategy for interpretation and museum information management. A core component of this strategy is BYOD, connecting CMoG visitors at a personal level to a range of rich, interpretive content on their personal devices. Understanding there were a number of known and unknown obstacles, the museum developed a cohesive, cross-institutional approach to identify and address each challenge and assure the program's success. This paper provides an overview of preliminary research findings and practices being developed around visitor-focused BYOD at CMoG."

Having worked in partnership with the museum for several years, our current research, which is the focus of this paper, explores a collection of data from decolonizing vantage points: videoing and interviewing at ten Ugandan heritage tribal and memorial sites. It is imperative to document potential lost heritage of the sites and, through oral interviews, capture the oral culture and untold stories of people who have lived their lives in the shadows of these sites. Hence, the core question of this paper is: how do we capture and re-represent through digital formats Ugandan voices and potential lost Ugandan heritage, both physical and oral? In 2014, we faced the question of how a Global South national museum might envision contemporary and culturally relevant Web 2.0/3.0 social-media participatory architectures with a meaningful interface, for the re-representation of tribal heritage sites and the oral culture that embodies them. In light of decolonizing notions and the colonizing history of Uganda, Web re-representation and education require careful attention to ideological visioning and Web 2.0/3.0 conceptualization. Information communications technology, and particularly Web 2.0/3.0 innovations, holds the potential to change and enhance how a museum presents itself and the culture it embodies and represents (Bowers, 2000, 2006; Lessig, 2002; Marcus, 2002, 2006; Morbey, 2006, 2009; Morbey et al., 2012; Parekh, 2000)."

    "abstract": "#Taull1123 is an immersive on-site experience that brings visitors of the Romanesque church of Sant Climent de Taüll (in the World Heritage Site Vall de Boí) to the past—precisely to the year 1123, when the apse of the church was painted with the iconic figures of God and saints. Those paintings were moved to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona in 1920. Now, with this project, they are virtually returned to the walls of the church thanks to a mapping structure of six high-quality projectors. Over the real remains of the Romanesque paintings, the paintings of the museum are projected, exactly in their original places, which becomes a truly augmented reality experience, but without mobile devices, for all visitors. Every half hour, a nine-minute audiovisual show dives into the past and represents the moment of the painting, eight hundred years ago, with the different stages and figures, and finishes with a simulation of the paintings complete as they were. For the creation of this show, all fragments of the original paintings, now in the Museum, were photographed, studied, and digitally restored. The missing parts were reconstructed by analyzing the remaining parts and the architectural and pictorial patterns of the ensemble. The process of the different layers of lines and colors of the original painting was rebuilt, too, for recreating the painting by brush effects. The music was composed and arranged using real sounds of the surroundings of the church and medieval instruments, digitally remastered."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "This paper reports on the Climate Literacy Zoo Education Network's (CLiZEN) work to design mobile technology to support interpreters (a.k.a. docents, explainers). Interpreters are tasked with supporting guest engagement and collaborative meaning making, and can benefit from tools that help them build on their existing interactions with guests around exhibit content. These tools are especially critical in interactive, technology-centered exhibits. However, introducing additional, complex tools is challenging, as interpreters already are busy maintaining conversations with guests. These tools need to have the appropriate functionality, content, and scaffolding so that they can support and improve interpreters' facilitation without hampering interpreters' existing strategies and goals. The CLiZEN team followed a user-centered design approach by working with adult and teen interpreters at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, Illinois, to develop a tablet support tool that aligned with interpreters' needs. The tool is designed to provide alternate representations of the core interaction of \"A Mile in My Paws\" for visitor audiences, through dynamic data representations (e.g., graphs, maps) and additional static media. These representations can also be used by interpreters to support and structure their presentations. Our work focused on three core areas of interpreters' use of the tablet support tool: content mastery, pedagogical content knowledge, and reflection. We found that the tool can support interpreters' existing strengths of appraising visitor interest and knowledge, and adapting exhibit content based on these appraisals. It also can complement interpreters' interactions with visitors by providing additional functionality around exhibit multimedia and supporting interpreters' professional development by facilitating reflection on past performance."

    "abstract": "In late 2013, the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) was awarded a National Leadership Grant together with partners from the Denver Art Museum, Grace Museum (Abilene, Texas), Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The team wondered whether a platform of engagement like DMA Friends might be applicable in other museums around the country with a wide variety of local conditions and business models. In the year since that award, the team has worked closely together to plan, develop, and soon launch pilot engagement platforms in each partner museum. To support the variety of needs and programs that each partner will pilot, the team has enhanced the existing Friends' software platform and crafted content strategies to allow the partners to create unique loyalty programs in each museum while also comparing their results directly. In this paper, the team reviews the planning process, issues encountered during design and development, and lessons learned around the tools required to launch a large-scale collaborative program of this kind. A summary of the process evaluation methods and findings is shared, as well as plans for future site-based evaluation and data analysis. Specific to platforms of engagement, the paper describes the team-based approach to crafting a collaborative platform of this kind, challenges around reconciling requirements from multiple independent stakeholders, issues with scalability and stability when ramping up to significant numbers of simultaneous users with large data histories, and suggestions for analysis of visitor behavior across a broad partnership."

    "abstract": "In a world of evolving visitor needs and expectations, it is increasingly important for art museum professionals to be agile in the design process. Initiating a dialogue with audiences early on can help maximize the emotional impact and educational effectiveness of nearly any museum project, including high- and low-touch interactives, labels, websites, and mobile apps. In this “how-to” session, participants learn about ways to integrate formative evaluation techniques into their development process as a way to link audience needs with the goals of museum initiatives. Presenters share how the Cleveland Museum of Art uses formative evaluation to inform a multitude of museum-wide projects. They explore the various components of this type of evaluation and guide participants through potential applications. Through hands-on activities, attendees have a chance to work in small groups to execute a formative research project from issue identification through presenting results. Additionally, participants learn how to conduct formative evaluation at a rapid pace and in a low-cost manner, allowing for the utmost level of customization and flexibility. Evaluators and non-evaluators alike leave ready to add formative evaluation to their development toolkit."

    "abstract": "Within this paper, we propose an approach to visualize the flow of visitors through an exhibition in space and time with the goal to assist curators and other museum professionals in the crucial task of analyzing visitor experience at exhibitions in museums. Detailed information about and deep insights into the preferences of visitors are crucial to improve the visitor experience in exhibitions. Accordingly, visualizations of visitor paths and trends must be capable of presenting data in meaningful and understandable ways. We present several solutions to visualize trends and repeating patterns in visitor behavior, as well as most frequently used exhibits. In connection with the exhibition's floor plans and deep knowledge about the visitor interactions at each exhibit, several interesting and sometimes surprising trends can be identified. Beside the visualization techniques, this paper describes how data can be collected when interactive computer-based exhibits are used in museums. As an example, the process of gathering data is described based on the scenario of an existing exhibition in which the data was not just utilized for visitor tracking for its own sake. Nevertheless, based on this data we are able to visualize the probability of visitors choosing a distinct exhibit depending on gender, age, time, season, or weekday. Finally, we include an overview of ideas how data can be gathered in the near future with new technologies for both interactive and non-interactive exhibits."

    "abstract": "The design of engaging digital access to collections and the creation of opportunities for richer collaborations with an informed online public are key recommendations for developing the GLAM sector's digital future (Mansfield et al., 2014). This presentation discusses Play it Again's Popular Memory Archive (PMA) (http://playitagainproject.org/), an online exhibition of Australian and New Zealand videogames of the 1980s, which is intended to elicit recollections from those who played their way through the era. We propose that curatorial practice of videogames can be advanced through an examination of the vernacular models and practices developed by online retrogame communities. Play It Again is an Australia Research Council-funded game history and preservation project focused on locally written digital games in Australia and New Zealand in the 1980s. Researchers from Flinders University (Adelaide), The University of Melbourne, and Victoria University (Wellington) are working in collaboration with the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI), Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision (formerly the New Zealand Film Archive), and the Berlin Computerspiele Museum. In October 2013, we launched the Popular Memory Archive, an online collaborative research portal and exhibition. The site provides a way to disseminate some of the team's research, but as important, it provides a mechanism for collecting information, resources, and memories from the public about 1980s' computer games. Conceived of as both an exhibition about local games and a research tool that capitalizes on participatory culture, the online archive is an example of what a local collection of games might look like and how Museum 2.0 might work with online knowledge communities. It addresses the need to look beyond the conservation of the physical objects to document the experiences of play, as well as a sense of the social and cultural reception of these works."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "This paper recognises and pays tribute to the playful turn in museums, whose significance is greater than it seems, in a world where ‘play' is associated with inconsequentiality, even pretence. I contend that at this historical moment, our innate faculty for playful thinking (by which I mean intuitive, associative thinking in particular) is critical: both underrated and immensely valuable. Museums are keepers of material culture, and places for reflecting on the physical and social worlds we inhabit. For the last four centuries they have also been implicated in shaping modern Western knowledge, so it is fitting that museums should also be in the vanguard of reactivating unconscious or intuitive modes of cognition – it's a timely counterbalance to the post-Enlightenment passion for rational analysis. Playfulness emerges from, and fuels, an authority-shift among museums and their publics – indeed in the process of knowledge-making itself. In the early 21st-century context of abundant information, adopting a more playful attitude is clearly advantageous for a museum in terms of attracting visitors. But the benefit can extend well beyond the museum. As I will argue, by cultivating our innate faculty for pattern recognition, we can better comprehend the complex systems in which we are all embroiled, and begin to imagine solutions to the global crises we face."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "In summer 2014, the Oxford University Museums were fortunate to be granted funding to install public Wi-Fi infrastructure across their four museums. This represented a challenge: not only did we have less than six months to install over one hundred new access points in our Grade 1 listed buildings, but in that time we also needed to develop engaging mobile content for our on-site visitors—with no dedicated budget. In this paper, I review the process we have been through to develop that content, starting with our quick and dirty research, to begin to get an idea of what was needed. I talk about our decision to approach the problem collectively, which adds a new layer of complexity as each museum has its own brand identity and type and style of content. I explain how we are adapting existing content to produce a \"minimum required offer\" for launch day. I explain our decision to create an aggregating framework that links out to discrete content—like our mobile-accessible audio guides—so that our content is not tied down in a format we may wish to change within less than a year as usage provides a greater understanding of visitor needs. I talk about some of the innovative experiments we are currently undertaking to see what else it will be possible to deliver in gallery as we seek to move from a \"minimum\" to an \"ideal\" offer. Experiments include using iBeacons to link natural history collections to tell the story of evolution; three-dimensional scanning to create architectural tours; geolocation to drive visitors between the museums and to the other cultural hotspots of the city; and user-collecting facilities to enable audiences to form their own collections."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Many venues are in the process of adopting indoor positioning systems (IPS) and wayfinding solutions, incorporating them into mobile apps, and hoping to improve visitor experience while gathering meaningful analytics. Industry giants like Google, Microsoft, and Apple are moving into the space (on the heels of a deluge of startups), mapping civic centers, hospitals, airports, stadiums, amusement parks, and even museums. With a clear view of the sky and a smartphone, there is no longer any reason to ask directions. Why shouldn't this same device provide us with this information during out time indoors? “Indoor location” is on track to become commonplace, but that doesn't make it easy. What is “location”? The familiar “blue dot” (often used as a synonym for “location awareness”) is not one singular technology. Digital “wayfinding” is made up of at least the following three interrelated components: locations, maps, and routes. Location is simply one of the critical aspects of the “context awareness” that visitors are coming to expect. These mobile devices could certainly create value for the visitor by determining WHAT they are actually trying to find, not just how to get there. While it is critical that we keep up with visitor expectations and provide context-aware services (including location), it is equally important that we don't give ourselves and our visitors a partial picture. IPS will give analytics about what the user is doing (what, where, and when). However, even the most elegant, thoughtful, and exciting digital experience will capture only a fraction of the total visitorship, and of that fraction only a subset of their actions will be handled via the mobile device. What about the other interactions they have with the Museum? Location should be a native data point for all interactions. If we include “location” data with every recorded transaction, not only those via the mobile app, we can start to make a complete picture of a visitor's behavior and preferences."

The museums architecture were also reviewed to turn this sort of new built-in infrastructure into what could be a new typology, for museum Reserve and Curate areas. Dynamic lighting, MR J3D collision and other software tools were tested and adapted to the real time applications added to the object live navigation. The bi-directional man-object communication which has been developed is set forth in this paper as a simple way to implement the IOT (Internet of Things) in the museological context."

Our digital strategy principles aim for an approach that is audience centred and insight driven. The Tate website gets approximately 1.5 million visits a month, and while analytics and other tracking tools provide a huge amount of data about user behaviour on the website, there are some limitations in getting to know the motivations and experience behind a click. In order to get a better understanding of who comes to our website, we have carried out substantial research divided into two phases whose methodology and results is explained in this paper. The first phase consisted of the analysis of the motivations and usage of the online collection. There is a wide range of reasons behind the visits to this section of the website, from research to looking for inspiration or remembering with emotion an artwork seen during a gallery visit. Moreover, visitors have different levels of art knowledge; therefore, the information required and content needs vary. This audience-research work helped to define our second piece of research, a survey for the whole website aimed to better know our online visitors and, as a result, define a segmentation that classified website visits based primarily on the motivations driving users to the site, but also taking into account a set of variables such as knowledge of art, vocational connection, online behaviour, and the connection of a particular website visit with the gallery experience. The nine segments defined at the end of the research were: personal interest research, student research, professional research, inspiration, enjoyment, art news, repeat visit planning, first visit planning, and organisational information."

    "abstract": "Using real-world projects from the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and the Clyfford Still Museum as the basis for our discussion, the authors identify the principles of an Agile design approach tailored specifically to the needs of museums—with their many stakeholders, diverse audiences, and limited resources. We discuss roles, timelines, and the benefits achieved by employing Agile methodologies to respond to evolving project needs and priorities. From 2013 to 2014, the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago engaged artist Goshka Macuga for its year-long artist residency program. With the bulk of the residency activities happening off site, the museum's challenge was to make the residency visible to MCA visitors. The result was a Web-based app for an in-gallery iPad kiosk for our on-site visitors, and a website for online visitors that would later serve as the archive for the project. In the years since the Clyfford Still Museum opened its doors, the museum's website had become obsolete. The design was outdated, the site's architecture was unwieldy, and the content management system no longer met the institution's needs. Our goal was to redesign the site using a new, flexible content management system (CMS) that could evolve as the project developed. In both cases, the Agile approach gave us the framework to address the projects' evolving needs, respond to stakeholders' priorities, and test our assumptions as the projects developed. Drawing on learnings from both projects, we provide actionable guidelines on roles, timelines, and scoping projects in phases to deliver top priorities early. We discuss the benefits of implementing Agile using a CMS so that real content can inform the development of the design, organization, and functionality of the final site. We consider the drawbacks of the Agile approach and the requirements for its successful application."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "We review the possibilities, pitfalls, and promises of recreating lost heritage sites and historical events using augmented reality and \"Big Data\" archival databases. We define augmented reality as any means of adding context or content, via audio/visual means, to the current physical space of a visitor to a museum or outdoor site. Examples range from simple prerecorded audio to graphics rendered in real time and displayed using a smartphone. Previous work has focused on complex multimedia museum guides, whose utility remains to be evaluated as enabling or distracting. We propose the use of a data­-driven approach where the exhibits' augmentation is not static but dynamically generated from the totality of the data known about the location, artifacts, or event. For example, at Bletchley Park, reenacted audio conversations are played within rooms as visitors walk through them. These can be called \"virtual contents,\" as the audio recordings are manufactured. Given that a number of documentary sources, such as meeting minutes, are available concerning the events that occurred within the site, a dynamic computer-generated script could add to the exhibits. Visitors' experiences can therefore react to their movements, provide a different experience each time, and be factually correct without requiring any expensive redesign. Furthermore, the use of a data-driven approach allows for the updating of exhibits on the fly as researchers create or curate new data sources within the museum. If artifacts need to be removed from an exhibit, pictures, descriptions, or three-dimensional printed copies can be substituted, and the augmented reality of visitor experience can adapt accordingly."

I argue that pursuing “digital storytelling” is not productive, since it is an essentially technologically determinist concept that leads not to digital stories but to stories that happen to be digital. In contrast, the emergence of ubiquitous digital technology directs museums to consider storytelling as spatial; mobile; location, context, and audience aware; interactive; transmedial (occurring across media); and intermedial (dependent on the interaction of media). This perspective is used to begin to articulate a storycraft for practitioners and to argue that museums need to invest in developing staff as storytellers with fluency in the narrative capacities afforded by the interactions between people, space, content, and technology."

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Museums and cultural heritage sites have a notable need to engage visitors in different ways. Within the work of the meSch project, we take the stance that the materiality complements and completes cognition, and therefore a personally meaningful and sensorily rich experience with museum exhibits and place can greatly improve both the visitors' experience and their appreciation of the museum's cultural values. By empowering cultural heritage professionals with a technological platform to help them create their own interactive, smart, and tangible exhibitions, meSch aims at making the encounter of digital and material more sustainable in museums. At the same time, it favors the creation of a do-it-yourself community that shares experiences and learns, grows, and develops over time, inspired by concurrent developments in new technology. This paper discusses the current efforts in meSch towards the definition of a general formalism, inspired by co-design activities with cultural heritage professionals, for specifying \"recipes\" for creating technology-augmented experiences to enhance the museum visit. Ingredients to such recipes include the appropriate description of digital information to be associated to objects and locations in an exhibition, as well as the detailed specification of how visitors' movements and actions can activate the contextualized presentation of that content."

    "abstract": "Digitized images and their underlying objects are in separate spheres of exchange. The objects underlying these assets are of irreducible material: they are physical things with unique meaning to their diverse source communities. With more cultural objects coming online, how are community voices being mediated through the museum space and to the visiting public? Building from anthropology research on the Tlingit Killer Whale Crest Hat, this paper looks at the placement of digital assets within a sphere of exchange between object creators and end users. The goal of this paper is two-fold: first, to take a closer look at a few examples of how museums work with community makers; and second, to begin a discussion that critically evaluates the future of community-driven digital projects."

This paper aims to identify issues which affect the uptake of digital technologies in decorative arts collections in two museum sites: Nanjing Museum, Jiangsu Province and the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, Sydney. It explores the ways in which digital and physical spaces are established for both discovery and interaction. The paper is informed by the belief that the nature of digital museum exhibition is to help visitors get sense of identity and pride of national culture through experience and reflection rather than to remember advanced digital technology."

Gallery One opened to the public, January 21, 2103 This session will address the three questions most frequently asked by colleagues: 1) Is the concept behind Gallery One working? We will take a look at the inaugural year of Gallery One. We will discuss gaming & playful experiences through the Gallery One Lenses. We will take a closer look at the ArtLens iPad app and share the museum's findings, including the audience research team's immersive study involving observations and intercept interviews with visitors. In addition, we will review analytics of the interactives, including the iPad app's onsite vs. offsite visitor experience, and discuss how the Collection Wall and ArtLens app are being utilized by visitors as tools for discovery and for creating new pathways through the museum's collections. 2) How can the museum sustain Gallery One? We will address the museum's digital media strategy, including 1) how the backend systems and staff workflows have been adjusted to maintain the \"big data,\" and 2) support for operating costs, from content development to hardware. We will also speak to new content development strategies for the iPad app that ensure as many objects as possible have rich media interpretation. 3) What are the next steps? What is Gallery One 2.0? - We will discuss plans for refreshed art installations and interactive technology in Gallery One. We will demonstrate the museum's new ArtLens for iPhone and Android. We will also share our process in adapting the iPad app functionality and content to the smaller device. And we will show how the Collections Wall is being leveraged to promote major exhibitions, and as a tool for gauging visitor interest in themes under development for permanent collection installations, exhibitions, and educational program development."

    "abstract": "Involving people in this participative process means also to increase the number of real visitors in museums. That idea stimulated the project “Archeowiki”. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the project involving six museums in Lombardia, Wikimedia Italia and some social and cultural associations (working with disabled people, aged people and students), sponsored by a grant made available from Fondazione Cariplo. An initial lack of archaeological contents on Wikipedia pages - due to absence of digital-archaeological-experts able to contribute the archaeological sections and difficulties in finding relevant and reliable information on these topics - motivated the realization of this project. The project favoured the digitization of about a thousand of images and documents belonging to museums involved in Archeowiki. One of the action of project is the realization of “Wikigite” (WikiTrips). Wikigite consists of a guided tour through the museums' archaeological collections (http://wlm.wikimedia.it/wiki/WikiGite), followed by a workshop hold by an archaeologist and a Wikipedia editor, with the aim of teaching to edit cultural contents on Wikipedia and, at the same time, to upgrade the free contents previously digitized by museums part of the project. Wikigite are currently ongoing, offering a didactical activity specifically designed for students, blind people and aged people. Wikipedia expert editors helped in creation of virtuous alphabetization process, by tutoring both teachers and students on how to co-write pages in Wikipedia, in particular on cultural subjects."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "When we think of Responsive Design, a singular experience on various screen sizes is what most often comes to mind. However, it's equally important that interactives are designed to be responsive in regards to location, time, preference, & skill. Using examples from several museums and related industries, this talk will inform participants on how they can more effectively work with staff and vendors to design sites, apps, touchscreens, and environments that better respond to patrons. Location-based The success of push notifications and apps like Foursquare show us the importance of geo-location. By creating experiences that cater to a visitor's location we not only improve wayfinding but also make sure guests don't miss out on a nearby friend or something of interest. Time-based When we think of how many visitors experience museums, we realize that patrons typically allow a certain amount of time. While this might be an hour or a day, the goal remains to provide them with an experience that leaves them wanting more. Time-based designs can help craft bespoke experiences for each guest and even help them coordinate transportation to and from the venue. Preference-based Whether it's language preference, how we like to receive information, or even specific styles that we're drawn to, preference-based experiences help get the most out of a visit without having to dig through information that isn't of interest. While this concept is relatively new to museums, other industries from athletics to air travel allow us to make several decisions well before events. Skill-based One can look at a television remote to see the importance of \"skill-based\" design. While there is a portion of the population that uses every button, there are just as many that use only basic functions like power, volume, or channel. Technology and video game companies are now creating systems that allow users to select a skill level to provide a custom display without excess information."

    "abstract": "In 2013 the Salon Doré, an 18th-century French period room in the Legion of Honor, was completely de-installed to undergo a yearlong conservation project. Throughout the year, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco's digital media interpretive fellow (made possible by a Kress Foundation grant) created a variety of digital content designed to document and interpret the work of museum conservators, architects, and curators. Videos, photography, 2- and 3D animations, and 3D printing projects were published on the Museums' website and social media channels, and provided unprecedented digital access to the entire process. This paper focuses the creation of non-linear, engaging, and interactive digital storytelling that communicates the rich history of an 18th-century period room and addresses the challenges and opportunities involved in producing an immersive digital experience within (and which does not detract from) an architectural experience."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach to interrogating different online collections to identify potential matches between them, using fuzzy logic-based data-mining algorithms. Potentially, information about objects from one collection could be used to enrich records in another where there are overlaps. But although there is a considerable amount of bibliographic and other kinds of data on the Web that share similar information, a standardized way of structuring such data in a way that makes it easy to identify significant relationships does not yet exist. In the case of historical photographs, the challenge is further exacerbated by the enormous range of subjects depicted, and the fact that surviving records are not always complete, accurate, or consistent and the amount of text available per record is very small. Fuzzy-matching algorithms combined with semantic similarity techniques offer a way of finding potential matches between such items when standard ontology and corpus-based approaches are inadequate, in this case helping researchers for the first time match photographs held in different archives to historical exhibition catalogue records. Keywords: linked data, semantic, ontology, metadata, fuzzy logic, co-reference."

    "abstract": "In this paper, Aaron Cope and Seb Chan deconstruct their acquisition of code and 'living software' for the permanent collection of the Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian's design museum and explore its implications for the future of collecting and conserving 'living' systems. Beginning in 2013 with the addition of an iPad app, Planetary, Cope and Chan have been working to update the museum's collection to include born-digital examples of design. Unlike other museums the approach that Cope and Chan have taken is novel - and natively digital - in that it has collected the 'final version of the 'object' along with earlier versions, change logs, and bug reports in a manner that enables their active exploration and use. Further, working with the donors/designers, the final code is open sourced. The original codebase now exists printed in OCR-A font on acid-free archival paper in a climate controlled storehouse - as well as on GitHub where it can be 'read', interacted with, and downloaded. This paper explores issues around the acquisition process, legal rights, source code repositories as preservation tools, emulation vs hardware vs concept propagation, collectivised ownership and preservation, and the intersection of curatorial practice and digital workers in museums."

While much of the underlying technology is already available, some challenges are still open with respect to design an augmented experience of travel in cities of art and culture. Most popular solutions in this context consist of a single-device experience, in which tourists use only one system at a time (a desktop PC, a smartphone, etc.) to plan and organize a cultural itinerary of the most interesting areas of a city. In this paper we present the prototype of a framework providing a multi environment and multi device solution for personalizing the cultural travel experience of tourists in the city of Florence (Italy). Our solution is composed of a natural interaction system, an application server platform and a mobile application working in a ubiquitous networks urban area with the aim to give local citizens and visitors a novel environment where they could create a personalised itinerary of the town, receive recommended suggestions based on their location and then discover the most relevant cultural points of interest to visit on daily basis."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "The Museum of History of Marseilles, France, relates astoundingly to a city founded 26 centuries ago by ancient Greek from Phocaea, which is now the second town in France. Moreover, and even more astoundingly, remains of the main entrance of the city, created then, with towers, walls and path, have been found just right in the center of today's town, when a mall was planned to be erected there, and foundations made, back in the late sixties. That's for the museum. Now let's turn to high tech and to web and mobile application: because the city of Marseilles was built there by the ancient Greeks, and then rebuilt right there by the ancient Romans, after the conquest of Jules Cesar, and then rebuilt again over the years of the Middle Age, there is a lot to show, which isn't visible, just there in the center of the town. This is the role of the Augmented Reality technique of the mobile application specially tailored for that museum. This application is geolocalized, and it uses the gyroscopic built-in device of most smartphones. It works in the open area of the museum and along the “historic path” which always has been the main street of the town, over centuries. People face the today's reality of the place, and they are shown how it was at the ancient Greek time, at the ancient Roman time, and at the Middle Age time, with 3D interactive models of these periods, and many hotspots leading to appropriate comments of scientific peoples and experts of the place and its history. Of course, a Web platform helps people to prepare their own visits, either inside the museum, or in the antique area, or along the historical path (as the web platform connects to the mobile application).

Such projects have met with different degrees of success, with some enjoying a positive response, while others recorded low levels of engagement. In this paper, we will provide a detailed description of some of these projects, present the results of in-depth evaluations conducted with visitors, and attempt to draw some conclusions on what worked, what didn't, issues encountered, and possible solutions.

This paper introduces the Epiphany Project, the problems it will address, and the potential for it to find relevant, valuable data within social media. The initial steps towards defining “inspiration” in a manner applicable to the work of museums are discussed, and the stakeholders who might benefit from Epiphany, their requirements, and the vision for the system's architecture are described.

The site was created as part of Project CHART (Cultural Heritage, Access, Research and Technology), a three-year collaborative project (2010-2013) funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) between Pratt School of Information and Library Science and three of New York's leading cultural Institutions, the Brooklyn Historical Society, Brooklyn Museum, and Brooklyn Public Library. This paper examines the Brooklyn Visual Heritage website from the diverse perspectives of these cultural institutions and the communities they serve, from geographic communities to those of scholars, historians, and educators, while also addressing technical aspects of user experience and the challenges of cross institutional collaboration. We consider questions of shared decision-making on website design, public access and use as well as issues regarding how the BVH collections will continue to grow, while expanding the use of social media to promote greater community participation as part of a sustainable model."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "Present unworkable situation: The European Commission requires the owner of disputed objects to prove that an object has not been stolen. Approximately 125 databases of missing objects are presently available on the Internet. This decentralized storage of relevant information makes combatting illicit traffic nearly impossible. Originally meant as a public information database to be consulted by police, custom, art dealers and others, the Art Loss Register makes searching by the average Sherlock - who is not trained as an Art Historian - nearly impossible if not unworkable. Solution The solution to the present problem is the cooperation of museum networks working 'bottom-up' within their domains instead of the present 'top-down' process by Police, Customs and Interpol, who are bound by a diversity of laws and local regulations - which resulted in the current 125 scattered databases of stolen art. Our paper will address these legal problems, the solutions offered based on the most recent IT developments in Collection Management Systems, a proposed data model, the synchronization of data packages and quick and the easy 'positive' registration and documentation of cultural heritage objects."

    "abstract": "When using digital spaces and social networking sites, we in the heritage world often tend to focus on marketing aspects. Digital is seen as a place for promoting the physical exhibitions and branding the institution in a positive way. But what happens if we have a crisis? Theft, fraud, and accidents are—unfortunately—also a part of the museum world, and therefore it is necessary to address such difficult issues socially. Crisis management is no longer just about “handling the press.” It is also about conversation with “likers” and followers, search engine optimization (SEO), and the production of background information, which goes beyond the traditional, written press release. We will examine and share experiences from three different situations in which social and digital crisis management became relevant to the National Museum of Denmark. In 2007, one of our national treasures was stolen. In 2011, it was discovered that a famous amber bear, believed to be prehistoric, was a modern fraud. And in 2013, one of our museums burned down."

    "abstract": "World War I: Impact and Aftermath August 2014 marks one hundred years since the outbreak of World War I - a highly significant watershed. Melbourne, as temporary national capital, was the centre of Australian wartime operations, and thousands of Victorians lost their lives or were damaged forever by the conflict. We have created an integrated mobile experience that offers visitors a complimentary layer of content in addition to what is physically available throughout the gallery and museum. The mobile experience includes off-site modes with content that visitors can engage with before and after a visit to the museum. When using the app, visitors will select one of eight characters who will frame their journey throughout the exhibition. Utilising beacon technology as triggers (over 30), the app will deliver relevant content to the visitor's mobile device based on their proximity to a specific gallery zone and the chosen character. The presentation will explore the development of the App and its integrated role in the overall exhibition experience. This is the first time that Museum Victoria has relied on mobile technology to such an extent, this is our first truly integrated app/exhibition experience. We have worked with Art Processors to develop a unique app and experience, the exhibition opens on the 30th August 2014."

    "abstract": "Korean government (especially, Ministry of culture, sports, and Tourism), according to a recently growing concerns and needs to the social role and impact of museums, becomes a leading force to bring out the paradigmatic shift in the purpose and role of museum and also in working practices. Technology-enabled museum learning is one of the new challenges and tasks of museums in accordance with the government policies. The best known technological devices are mobile devices such as cellular (mobile ) phones, tablet computers, and smart pads (e.g., iPAD). Such devices have been described and promoted as a key component to practice innovative learning approach called ‘Smart learning' which is a term similar to or exchangeable with mobile learning. The smart learning in museum, in short, ‘smart museum', has been practiced in Korea under governmental sponsorship called “ Museum: Humanities on road” since 2013. Nation-widely spread 10 museums in 2013 and 25 museums in 2014 were the participants of the Smart learning project with various depth and breadth in using smart technologies and understanding smart museum education. This study, in this context, aimed to examine what types of smart museum learning has been practiced and what characteristics of learning were noticed among the smart museums, hence eventually generating a framework of smart museum learning. For the purpose, this study conducted interviews with educators and the participant students of the smart museums, while analyzing their smart learning programs by participant observation as well. The results of this study showed a wide range of practices based upon diverse understanding and approaches to smart museum education, which can be summarized as four categories ofthe smart museum learning: ① development of museum's own app, ② device-centered hands-on practices,③ use of smart museum learning solution, and ④ a convergent model of smart technologies and pedagogical approaches."

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in many parts of the world in utilising the capacities and affordances of digital games to support learning within the formal arenas of curriculum and school. The use of games-based pedagogies via online and mobile Internet-based technologies is seen as providing much potential for innovative, effective and accessible contemporary teaching and learning (Beavis, 2012). The Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) in partnership with roar films (Tasmania), Screensound Australia and Screensound Tasmania have developed an educational game, The Voyage, based on the nineteenth century convict experience. The Voyage takes the user on a journey from London to Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania) where players, as the ship's Surgeon Superintendent, are rewarded for the number of healthy convicts they deliver to the fledging British colony. The game is based on detailed historical data, utilising documented ship paths, convict and medical records and diaries. Using The Voyage as a case example, this paper will focus on how museums can best exploit the principles learning in games-based environments underlying these. The paper will also discuss what museums can learn from how young people engage in and learn in gaming environments, addressing how could museums develop and evaluate products based around games and gaming technologies."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "Digital technologies are widespread throughout museums. Computer graphics, virtual reality, augmented reality and holographic display not only help create exhibits but also enhance audiences' experiences. Holographic display has been used for a long time in the exhibition field by projecting a virtual image through a semi-transparent screen that is spatially aligned with the physical exhibits. Compared with virtual reality (VR) which all takes place in the virtual space, holographic displays enhance the audiences' perception of reality by displaying additional information on the physical object with the flavor of augmented reality. As an attempt to further extend the potential of the holographic display, we propose a new exhibition system that combines virtual reality technology with conventional holographic display, and create a prototype to verify the effectiveness. The distinctive features are as follows: 1) 3D display: Even though conventional holographic display is 3D, it displays images on a single layer offering a limited depth effect. Whereas, we use a 2-layer display and apply the stereoscopic imaging to the front display. 2) 3D interaction: Camera faces the audience and tracks their positions and gestures to enable interaction between the system and the audience. In this paper, we present the design of our system, focusing the user study on how effective is the system in creating the 3D spatial perception. Our initial investigation suggests that the newly conceived holographic display offers the users not only more accurate 3D spatial perception, but also better spatial awareness and realism. Furthermore, it helps the users understand exhibition contents easier and better."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "Considering the recent developments in museum and exhibition design, adapting them to the contemporary digital age, museum professionals have increasingly employed multimedia in their exhibitions. The creative use of technology in a historical and archaeological exhibition allows museums to place the artifacts in their context, to explain complex ideas, to reconstruct historical events, to increase interaction and to simulate and stimulate new experiences. A museum unique in Italy, which makes technology the one and only communication mean with the subordinate function of being a place of knowledge, learning, and entertainment, is the MAV (Museo Archeologico Virtuale) in Herculaneum. In a different manner, a good example of well-balanced design of multimedia tools inserted within the exhibition is the recent exhibition inside the Site-Museum of Pont du Gard, an archeological site in the south of France including a Roman aqueduct 50 km long. The paper, through a comparison between the two case studies, aims to provide a presentation of the museums and their exhibitions and to reflect on the use of digital technologies for archaeological communication."

    "abstract": "As video games play an increasingly widespread role in society, museums and related institutions are launching various initiatives to catalog, preserve, and exhibit video games and related media. Collecting and preserving physical video games comes with challenges. Furthermore, with the advent of smartphones, tablet computers, and social networking, many games are increasingly released digitally—having no physical component and accessible only through download or streaming from “the cloud.” Digitally distributed games are problematic to collect, catalog, and preserve. This paper discusses the challenges the Seattle Interactive Media Museum (SIMM) and other museums face when attempting to catalog digitally downloadable, streaming, and “cloud-based” media as part of their collections. Using the metadata schema for physical games at SIMM as a springboard, each metadata element was analyzed and revised to accurately represent digitally distributed games. The schema was then tested through the actual cataloging of samples of digitally distributed games in order to determine where breakdowns occur. In addition to revealing the necessary information elements for digitally distributed games, our work offers insight for other institutions facing the challenge of collecting and cataloging born-digital materials in other domains and media."

Furthermore, with the advent of smartphones, tablet computers, and social networking, many games are increasingly released digitally—having no physical component and accessible only through download or streaming from “the cloud.” Digitally distributed games are problematic to collect, catalog, and preserve. This paper discusses the challenges the Seattle Interactive Media Museum (SIMM) and other museums face when attempting to catalog digitally downloadable, streaming, and “cloudbased” media as part of their collections. Using the metadata schema for physical games at SIMM as a springboard, each metadata element was analyzed and revised to accurately represent digitally distributed games. The schema was then tested through the actual cataloging of samples of digitally distributed games in order to determine where breakdowns occur. In addition to revealing the necessary information elements for digitally distributed games, our work offers insight for other institutions facing the challenge of collecting and cataloging born-digital materials in other domains and media. Keywords: video games, interactive media, game apps, born-digital, digital distribution, metadata."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "This session will help you to plan how to make your web services responsive, mainly focussed on mobile-responsive and tablet-responsive displays, but also covering other less well-known aspects of responsive-design including large-screen responsiveness, orientation-responsiveness and responding to users' emotional needs. You will get evidence-based arguments for how you should consider responsive-design conceptually, backed up with real-life issues from experience of live implementations. You will hear how to move from important theoretical principles to useful strategic implementation. This session is user-focussed based upon an understanding of users' needs in their daily lives. The session includes user-involvement and testing, evidence-gathering, interface design, development options, managed digital assets, budget limitations and more. It offers pragmatic solutions to challenges and tactical options to navigate projects round barriers. It also considers the role of prioritisation and compromise in order to deliver continuous incremental benefits. Some examples from other smaller projects are also included, to give a balanced range of options when you only have a limited budget. You should attend if you are responsible for managing the delivery of web digital experiences. No detailed technical knowledge needed to gain from this session. Take-aways: - Greater overall awareness of how responsive services benefit your users - Understanding of common issues that affect how displays can usefully respond to mobile and tablet use - A basic technical grounding in the way responsive sites work and implementation issues - How to prioritise development effort based on evidence of user need, including web analytics and qualitative research - Practical planning advice on breaking down work into deliverable enhancements - Confidence to make informed decisions about supplier engagement."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "As an example of Open Authority (Phillips, 2013), the Art Maps application epitomises an upcoming tendency in the broader museum field – that of an open-source platform inviting contributions from users around the world, while retaining the institution's authority. Developed by Tate and the Horizon Digital Research Institute between 2012 and 2014, Art Maps crowd-sources geographical data to map the gallery's collection, and allows users to suggest multiple locations for each artwork in recognition of the subjective nature of the relation between art and place, and of the personal experience each user might have of a specific location. As the cartographic effort is entrusted to users rather than being ‘imposed from above' (Harley 1989) by the institution, the power inherent to map production is democratically shared among all users, albeit moderated and eventually sanctioned by Tate. Herein we explore how users accessing Art Maps outside the gallery might be in some ways reframing their own environs, defining a contract with the gallery on the lines of that between performers and spectators in mixed reality games (Benford et al., 2006), which transposes not only the collection but the very attitude associated with contemplative engagement with art, to the outside world."

Museum audiences are constantly changing how they locate and interact with cultural information. Creating and distributing digital resources should be a priority for the entire museum profession - and not just museum technologists. Museums must dedicate themselves to educating both visitors and staff through the use of technology. Clear digital objectives can help guide an impactful and sustainable strategy."

    "title": "Responsive Design: How Museums Can Thrive in the Universe of Desktops, Tablets, Smartphones, and More",
    "author": "Jack Ludden",
    "url": null,
    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "In the world of cultural institutions, an interesting trend is emerging in the digital space. More and more museums are presenting their Web content using “responsive design.” This means that online content will be presented in different ways depending on the device on which it is being viewed. In other words, a museum's website may appear different when it is seen on a desktop versus a tablet versus a smartphone. The “responsiveness” of these designs allows online content to be more facile across today's ever-changing universe of devices. It no longer assumes a superiority of one device over another. This gives a greater breadth of creativity to museums in creating their interface, as well as their other content. Responsive design is an extraordinarily important technique for museums to embrace. This session will address three aspects of the impact of using responsive design. First, the paper will examine the core of this coding architecture. An institution must carefully examine a variety of code bases before selecting the one that best fits its needs. Second, the session will examine how people's job roles and responsibilities are impacted by the use of responsive design. In the past, people's job roles were often quite segregated from one another. Third, the session will review how the use of responsive design impacts the audience of a cultural institution. The digital space continues to grow at impressive rates. In addition, this growth occurs at a relatively rapid rate. Those who tend to rely on technology are used to devices arriving with fanfare, only to be quickly replaced with the “newer and better version.” People are not forced to choose between a smartphone, tablet, and desktop. Instead, people are invited to simply own them all. For better or for worse, responsive design teaches the audience of a cultural institution to expect a more flexible and responsive digital experience overall. Keywords: responsive design, mobile development, organizational change, audience expectations."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "The modern museum has been a global concept since the 1700's. However, in the 20th Century, Europe and the United States saw a great surge in museums and museum culture, which wasn't shared in other parts of the world. In the West, museums have spent the past few generations becoming tenements for cultural and historical understanding – but in most parts of Asia, this role has been fulfilled by temples, monuments, folkways, and other vehicles besides museums. Today, South Korea is home to 500 museums and galleries – just a fraction of the 2,000 in New York City alone. And while Asia currently experiences a “late bloom” in museums – opening thousands in just the last few years – this phenomenon is occurring within a digital age instead of an industrial one. Today, Asian countries such as China, Singapore, Japan and even North Korea are heavily investing in their national museum infrastructures. But while the tendency is to follow the West's blueprint, establishing societal embrace of museums now presents vastly different implications than it did a century ago. Meanwhile, the ways that people across the globe create, receive and share content is evolving as rapidly as technology itself. How will the museum world and its approaches evolve in response to a growing Asian audience? In this presentation, we will compare Asia's budding museum renaissance with that of the West's in previous centuries. We will also survey how different Asian societies have traditionally approached cultural and historical scholarship, and how technology can be a bridge to contemporary museum approaches in the region. Additionally, we will explore how shifts in migration, tourism, and content sharing are crucial elements to consider while museums rethink their role in global society."

    "abstract": "The increasing number of technologies and devices allows cultural institutions to provide a large variety of different user experiences. For a number of reasons, however, these different communication “channels” often diverge: e.g. the text on the panel on the side of the exhibit is different from the text on the web and form the text of the audio guide or from the story told by the interactive APP… Moving content across different channels entails a number of often underestimated issues, like media transfer (e.g. from video to audio only: does the audio still make sense?), optional content (e.g. directions, which make sense only for visitors who are in the real place), context information (e.g. about the institution hosting a work of art, which does not make sense for real visitors but is quite necessary for a video on Youtube), etc. This paper proposes a unifying conceptual/technological framework allowing a unique content development that can be (adaptively) delivered on the various channels. The framework consists of three components: an authoring environment (1001stories), a delivery environment and a content development methodology."

    "abstract": "On the occasion of the restoration of “Sala delle Asse” (literally, “the hall of planks”) by Leonardo da Vinci at the Sforza Castle in Milan, a multi-faceted communication project by HOC-LAB at Politecnico di Milano (Italy) was devised and is currently being implemented. The ultimate goal is quite new: to allow people to follow the restoration day by day, sharing hypothesis, discoveries, successes as well as discomfitures, fostering a sense of belonging and care for this long-forgotten work of art. A number of other communication goals must be fulfilled in order to make the visitors' experience complete and satisfactory: to provide background information from a cultural, historical and artistic point of view; to illustrate the restoration's issues (like what kind of analysis are to be performed and what kind of choices are made); to “tell stories”, long or short, about what goes on, etc. Following the above, a complex multimedia communication project has been designed: it entails a website, with monthly content updates, a set of short interviews to the people involved (experts, restorers, archivists, historians, politicians, sponsors…), snapshots of the room and the people at work, an exploratory portal including a large collection of various materials, such as documents, images, videos, and – most importantly – digital multimedia stories, illustrating the room's history, the decoration, the diagnostics techniques, the analysis techniques, etc. Users are envisaged to visit the website repeatedly to check the new content and get acquainted with the news about the room. In the case of Sala delle Asse project, the restoration has not closed but rather opened the room's doors to all eyes, showing what goes on day by day: it is probably the first (brave) example in the world of a restoration work being told as it unfolds rather than when it is completed."

Through a literature analysis and close study of two cases—Red een Portret (Save a Portrait) at the Amsterdam City Archives and a photo-tagging project of the Maria Austria Institute on the Vele Handen (Many Hands) crowdsourcing platform—this study identifies those conditions and implements them in the design of a model to assist in the design and evaluation of effective cultural heritage crowdsourcing projects."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "Changes in museum practice and the ways in which people can experience museums in the digital age have increasingly become key topics in discussions about both museum practice and museum theory. Although employing digital technology in museums is a recent phenomenon, museums, as social institutions, have always been strongly influenced by socio-economic, cultural and technological changes. In the case of South Korea, in particular, digital culture plays an important role since S. Korea is a technologically advanced country, especially with regards to the development of innovative digital devices and the degree to which digital technologies have been embedded in daily life. In the museum context, digital technology has had a profound influence on the ways in which S. Korean museums manage their collections, develop their websites and adopt innovative media for eye-catching exhibition tools. Yet, the same does not appear to be true for interpretation, learning and, in general, the way in which museums interact with their visitors, particularly in view of the discussion related to the ‘new museology'. The aim of this research is to investigate the degree to which S. Korean museums and related social systems have changed and interconnected with each stakeholder in the digital age. This paper will present a conceptual framework based on activity theory (Nardi, 1996), which could be used in order to link and explain the relationship between structure and agency in the museums. Moreover, it will address the potential stakeholders who influence decision-making in museums, including government bodies, museum professional bodies, academic departments, museum practitioners and the public."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "Even as museums continue to push content out to the network and support experiences at a distance, the threshold to the physical museum endures as a highly visible and symbolic space, where trust and expectations are built, protocols established and affordances noticed. But, today, are these threshold spaces still fit for purpose? Is the use of media within these spaces appropriate for modern modes of visiting? Are the informational metaphors (such as the architectural plan) sensitive to today's media literacies? Does visitor connectivity suggest new types of encounter? And does visitors' experience of playing, buying, discovering and learning in other parts of their lives point to alternative means of scaffolding the museum threshold event? Drawing upon the work of two connected research projects (in the UK and Denmark) this paper shows how museum threshold media might be influenced usefully by other sectors that (arguably) have more evolved concepts and practices around ‘threshold', ‘orientation' and ‘initiation' – specifically retail, gaming and performance. The paper will also explain how three experimental media interventions (using these new conceptual lenses) were tested within three real museum contexts – the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology (London), New Walk Museum and Art Gallery (Leicester) and Chatsworth House (Bakewell, Derbyshire). Finally, the paper concludes by rethinking the idea of museum ‘threshold' (defined, instead, by intention and action rather than physical parameters, perhaps more by time rather than space), and ends by reflecting upon the influence that the web is having on the conceptualisation, strategic use and design of our physical museum entrances."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we review recent developments in technology-enhanced posing activities in art museums. We present a sociocultural perspective on the intertwined cognitive and social aspects of gesture and posing in meaning making, and we discuss how these relate to visitors' interpretive processes in encounters with art. We present two cases in which interpretive technologies have been designed with posing activities. The cases are taken from a nationally funded design-based research project that entailed close collaboration over several years between a university and a national museum of art, architecture, and design. The use of photography by Edvard Munch in his self-portraits was the theme for the interpretive activities, which had young people between the ages of fifteen and eighteen as the main focus group. Interviews, field observations, and video recordings of over fifty posing sessions comprise the main data corpus. Applying methods from interaction analysis, we found that posing interactions frame an interpretative process that moves through cycles of talk, movement, comparison, focus, and adjustment. We discuss in this paper how perspectives and findings from this research may inform a set of design principles for incorporating ‘posing' in interpretive activities in art museums. We also reflect on the way academia and the museum collaborated in the design process, and on the interaction between the different institutional perspectives and approaches."

The design of this tool has been focused on the Cultural Heritage (CH) field, even though its versatility makes it a general-purpose tool. Thanks to its main features, like the capability to efficiently stream high-resolution 3D models and the possibility to build an interactive 3D viewer integrated with the rest of the Web elements intuitively, 3DHOP is particularly suitable for online CH presentations, where the often mandatory need to handle highly detailed digital representations of cultural artefacts, is almost always paired with the need to make these models available to a wider audience. 3DHOP is written in JavaScript and heavily based on the SpiderGL and Nexus libraries. It uses the WebGL subset of HTML5 for efficient rendering. Thanks to its modular structure, and a declarative-like setup, 3DHOP is characterized by a smooth learning curve and results to be easy to learn and easy to use. Furthermore, it may be configured and customized at different levels, making it accessible for people with different programming skills."

    "abstract": "While corporations have started to use Vine for advertising, museums have been slow to adopt this medium. Given the number of museums with Vine accounts, many institutions seem to acknowledge the possibility in short videos. However, most museums are yet to exploit Vine for its full potential. Short-videos are an important way in which users communicate with each other. Museums need to understand the possibilities for this media in order to engage with visitors in authentic ways. This paper will consider the potential of short video and stop-motion video (Vine and Instagram) for museums in order define best practices for museums and project possible future directions for the medium. Drawing from our own experiences using Vine and Instagram at museums, we will focus on three main themes transparency, information dissemination, and collaborative communication. Counteracting the the dearth of scholarship on the use of short-videos by museums, this paper will offer practictioners concrete ways to implement this cost-effective tool in their institutions."

    "abstract": "The session will consider the changing role of digital media teams in the museum sector. It will explain the digital transformation strategy of the Imperial War Museums' Digital Media department and use five examples where we've introduced transformative digital processes or techniques to different areas of the museum. We'll discuss how this approach can be applied and adapted to other organisations, regardless of size or type of institution. Each example will consider: the objectives of the individual project how a digital process was used the success of using the digital process in the project the lessons that can be applied to organisations of different sizes The examples of digital transformation are: 1) Agile project management We'll talk about how we used agile project management to build consensus across multiple Learning teams at different sites, and how that enabled the successful delivery of a project in a department that had a long history of failed projects. 2) Product management We'll explain how introducing a product management function has changed the relationship between Digital Media and the museum's Commercial division. We'll talk about the role of a product manager and how we can use conventions from companies like Google and eBay in a museum context. 3) Web Commissioning Group We'll show how the establishment of a Web Commissioning Group has changed the museum's approach to web content and its production. We'll talk about the way we've run the meetings and how a common vocabulary for audiences, content formats and metrics has enabled the museum to manage and prioritise the production of content. 4) Collections Access We'll talk about how we've re-imagined the museum's Collections Access function as a digital-first product that includes social media, comments on the website and bespoke web content as well as the traditional telephone, email and in-person service. 5) Computer Club We've introduced a Computer Club and run monthly sessio."

    "abstract": "Since the cabinets of curiosity of yore, museums have collected widely and deeply, building collections that they now draw upon to interpret the diversity of the natural world and the heights of human achievement and expression. A game, in contrast, maintains a singular focus on a system of rules that ties together game objects and player actions. How, then, can a game maintain that strict focus while doing justice to the rich, heterogenous collections and content of a museum? This paper explores the nature of this challenge and examines how a handful of museum games respond to it, using either extrinsic or intrinsic gameplay. Extrinsic games adopt existing game mechanics as generic containers for content. Intrinsic games devise novel gameplay that integrates content into the game choices and consequences. Museum game developers must understand the benefits and risks of these contrasting approaches, as well as the implications for development effort, playtesting, and learning outcomes, so they can make the best design choices for their project."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "This paper reviews several case studies of interactive transmedia installation that focus on tangible and intangible global cultural heritage. As a form of “experimental ethnographic documentary” for the preservation and extension of living cultural memories, Morocco Memory II (1999), Sanctuary (2005), Illuminations (2013), and Borubudur and Prambanan (2014), use networked computer systems, sensors, and physical computing to integrate database narrative, text, poetry, handcraft, music, photography, film, as well as indigenous living plants and traditional spices. The interactive transmedia approach was developed by the author as a way of providing audiences the means to dynamically engage cultural knowledge, experiences, and memories within an immersive multisensory environment designed to both heighten and deepen the emotional and intellectual experience of the content. These works draw on concepts and structures in neuroscience, ecology, mathematics (combinatorics), and music (polyrhythms), and result in a form of “emergent storytelling.” Ubiquitous computing and embedded systems allow each member of the audience to individually and collectively explore and associate the multimedia content, thereby extending traditional and contemporary media and artforms. These works employ objects from material cultures and everyday life as “implicit” interfaces in the digital systems, and in this way provide entry for people from many walks of life."

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances, museums still have a problem. They know relatively little about their visitors, and their understanding of how best to influence visitor behavior significantly lags common practice in other sectors. Behavioral analysis of visitors to museums typically starts with attendance statistics and frequently involves staff-administered surveys, but is seldom broad or frequent enough to aid in the continuous improvement of museum practice. As a result, the knowledge we have of our visitors is minimal and episodic, and our tools are crude and inefficient. In 2012, the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) launched an effort to transparently and continuously monitor the long-term engagement of visitors with the museum. Dubbed DMA Friends, the approach emphasizes the repeat participation of visitors with the museum's collections and programs, offering customized rewards in return for frequent engagement. This scalable and flexible digital platform gives the museum the ability to track individual activity, with nearly fifty thousand unique visitors joining in the first year. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the data gathered to date concerning the adoption and visitor engagement generated by the DMA Friends program. The paper also proposes new methods for the real-time collection and analysis of in-gallery engagement data, and investigates statistical trends and correlations that can be used by museums to enhance the impact of their engagement programming. And while the program has exceeded our initial hopes and expectations, the results from several qualitative surveys and in-depth interviews with members of the DMA Friends program suggest a path for several important improvements."

This data is stored in proprietary databases and is not readily available for use. Recently, museums embraced the Semantic Web as a means to make this data available to the world, but the experience so far shows that publishing museum data to the linked data cloud is difficult: the databases are large and complex, the information is richly structured and varies from museum to museum, and it is difficult to link the data to other datasets. This paper describes Karma, our system for mapping museum data to the Linked Data Cloud. We describe the capabilities in Karma to easily map the museum data to RDF according to an ontology of the user's choice, to link the data to hub datasets such as DBpedia and other museum datasets, and for curating the data."

    "abstract": "The Hong Kong Maritime Museum would have approximately two years to plan its expansion from an older site that contained two galleries to a new one that had fifteen. New galleries would have to be created. The collection would have to be moved. The museum would close its doors to the public for twelve months, and the only public presence would be the museum's website. The website would have to be reengineered and restructured for more dynamic content. This meant in part increasing photos of collection items and adding historic films. The strategy at hand was to create an online gallery for each of the fifteen sponsored spaces. Each online gallery would introduce the public to the theme of the gallery and profile the individual or company that was sponsoring it. Ideally, each online gallery would include photos of the highlighted collection items that would be on display. The public would be encouraged to follow the progress of the museum's construction and learn more about the new gallery themes. Since the CMS could not serve as the dataset for the collection, other options had to be explored. In the end, the museum turned to flickr as a way to host its online collection photos. By utilizing flickr's application program interface, multi-level category sets, tags, and hypertext fields, the museum created its first online collection. And later, when the museum launched its new website, the flickr dataset was used to populate the new content. This paper will explore the strategies the museum faced in creating a dynamic online collection. Keywords: flickr, API, social media."

    "abstract": "The new idea of urban intelligence is leading to a new concept of the city of the future, in which the relationship between the contemporary reality of the historical city becomes a key factor in the rethinking urban \"smartness,\" through a total commitment to historical and artistic heritage, engaging the virtual city of ICTs. Smart cultural heritage, in fact, can be conceived as an element of the identity of a place, to share through the implementation of smart technologies, knowledge and social inclusion, for total participation to the promotion of cultural heritage. This need is particularly evident in the Italian territory, where cultural resources are widespread and represent a potential lever for improving local economies and the attractiveness of the territories. This article deals with smart enhancement of cultural heritage considering the experience of some Italian smart cities that are configured as bearers of cultural, tangible and intangible values to be protected. Some Italian projects that intend to define and develop an open platform for intelligent services for the cultural sector will be considered. These cases represent smart and open source systems, enabling the concept of personalized and contextualized exploration of the cultural good (augmented fruition), made also on the basis of experiential analysis of the territory. National experiences will be compared to allow us to understand how the relationship between smart city and cultural heritage is today the testing ground for a rethinking of the idea of the museum as no more just a traditional space of exposure and use, but including a virtual and urban territory that defines a new concept of smart heritage."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "In 2010, after a radical reconstruction of both buildings and exhibitions, STAM re-opened as a modern city museum. The permanent exhibition leads visitors along a chronological trail of objects and multimedia which trace the development and growth of Ghent, one of the largest towns in Belgium. But, whereas most museums start in the prehistoric period, STAM starts in the present-day city, with the motto ‘from the present to the past and back again'. STAM's real showpiece, its raison d'être, is the city itself. In order to tell ‘the story of Ghent', STAM makes use of digital media on a much larger scale than most other city museums. The web-based software application Views of Ghent reinforces the connection between the different rooms (and times in history) in the permanent exhibition. Views of Ghent contains maps, pictures and textual information about streets, squares and buildings in the past and present. And there is more: the exhibition contains entire rooms covered with screens, 3D models and digitally enriched photographs on floors and walls, next to more traditionally curated rooms. For instance, the room that focuses on the period after the Second World War is set up as a lounge, where visitors can actively choose what film footage they wish to see. Two MS Surface multi-touch tables contain short film fragments about Ghent. The visitors can pick and choose fragments of their own choice and compose their own film, which can then be projected on a big screen. STAM tries to implement multimedia, 3D and technology in a well-considered way. We actively use technology when it brings an added value to the story, this of course within the limits of what is practically and financially feasible. In 2012, a temporary exhibition about Ghent photographer Edmond Sacré (1851-1921) could be visited with a smartphone that allows you to compare Sacré's photograph of a particular location with the present day situation on Google Streetview.

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "Almost any project, large or small, requires the collaboration of participants. And these participants will bring with them different skills, knowledge, professional background and their own outlook and perspective. Negotiating the expectations and opinions of diverse teams within an organisation can be challenging enough but what happens in projects that require the collaboration of participants in different organisations? In this paper, multi-institutional and, indeed, multinational collaboration will be investigated. Two case studies will be used as illustrative examples to explore the nature of collaboration – and how to undertake collaboration successfully. The first example is the development of a series of Field Guide apps that have been produced by a partnership of eight museums around Australia. These apps were successfully released on 1 May 2014; the result of two years of work by scientists, photographers, project coordinating staff, designers and programmers. The second example is the Biodiversity Heritage Library global group. The Biodiversity Heritage Library is a project that aims to make freely available full text digitised literature via a dedicated website. This project now has nodes around the world, and a global committee has been established to act as a communication tool and reporting forum. In the case of the global Biodiversity Heritage Library, challenges for collaboration include such practical things as dealing with time zones to find teleconference opportunities, dealing with different first languages within the group, and finding funding to attend global meetings.This paper will explore barriers and benefits to collaboration and will provide some insights into what can make collaborative projects succeed."

There is a body of recent literature on the opportunities and challenges of developing mobile interpretation for museum visitors (Samis 2007, Samis and Pau 2009, Petrie and Tallon 2010, Gangsei and Svenonius 2011) but surprisingly little research on mobile content itself. At a moment when the technological barriers to offering a mobile guide are decreasing but the cost of content development remains high, we would be well-served by a thoughtful, evidence-driven look at mobile content. What resonates with visitors and what doesn't? Do visitors expectations for mobile content differ between art museums, historic sites, and science museums? Where are we missing opportunities to connect with people? This paper presents the results of mobile content research from a range of London cultural sites including the National Gallery, the Science Museum, and others. Our paper will present key findings from the research and insights into patterns and trends that appear across the studies. Some of the findings confirm conventional wisdom while others suggest new approaches or unexpected priorities. But taken as a whole, the findings provide us with a set of operating principles for the development of successful mobile content."

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a forthcoming online catalogue of Chinese painting and calligraphy in the collection of the Seattle Art Museum (SAM). This online scholarly catalogue is the result of five years of planning, research, and experimentation under the auspice of the J. Paul Getty Foundation. This proposal summarizes the processes by which SAM selected a modest and largely unpublished collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy, and thought through the needs and functionalities of the catalogue. This catalogue will present an innovative way for studying and presenting classical Chinese painting and calligraphy. During the course of the project, SAM's collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy grew substantially, adding significant works of the Ming and Qing dynasties as well as from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Their importance led to the conclusion that the new acquisitions should be constantly added in the catalogue. Therefore, the active acquisition program led to a fundamental change in our expectation of the function of the online ‘catalogue,' namely that it should be a portal of new scholarship and new acquisitions. This online catalogue features thoughtful and provocative essays about major works by renowned professors and curators in the United States and Asia, with high-resolution, zoomable images of the works of art, and thorough documentation—including transcriptions and translations of inscriptions and colophons, and seals that are transcribed, identified, and located. Readers are encouraged to post comments about the works of art and the accompanying essays, as well as to formulate answers to questions that we put forward under the section “Questions for Thought.” By the time of the conference, the catalogue will have had a three-month trial period, and we will be able to report on its reception by the scholarly community. We expect to address issues of maintenance and sustainability of the online catalogue with colleagues. Keywords: Chinese painting, catalogue, Getty Foundation, OSCI."

    "abstract": "In 2010 The Cleveland Museum of Art rolled out a brand new website, winning online acclaim and garnering numerous design awards based on a high-concept idea: while the museum's galleries are closed during its $350 million building expansion, make its collections available online. Allow online visitors to explore virtually, getting lost in the world-class art. But although visually distinctive, the website was far from perfect: it couldn't support the technology or communications goals of the museum going forward, because of its underlying, heavily customized CMS and its shallow information architecture.. To regain financial and developmental control of the museum website, Information Management and Technology Services (IMTS) managed the migration of the website from its heavily-customized legacy content management system (Sitecore CMS) to a flexible, open-source CMS (Drupal) that could be maintained and expanded in-house. This paper explores the managerial and technical processes required to replace the website with a new one that looked the same, but delivered a better user experience."

    "abstract": "This paper describes an ongoing collaboration between the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pittsburgh to explore and study how emerging gigapixel image technology can be used to support science communication and learning in natural history museums. Multitouch based explorations of dynamic visual information spaces present unique user interface and interaction design opportunities and challenges. This case study focuses on a human centered design approach to technology innovation, by describing the design research methodologies used and the series of prototypes developed. We share findings from a series of user studies to optimize navigation, annotation and exploration in a zoomable user interface, and highlight the unique affordances of multiscalar image platforms to scaffold disciplinary observation and engagement with scientific content. Lastly, we discuss future design directions and offer some frameworks that can be adopted by museums when seeking to incorporate explorable, high-resolution imagery into exhibit experiences, both on the museum floor and on-line."

    "abstract": "The number of social media users in Indonesia is relatively high compared to other countries. In 2012, 19.5 million Indonesian are on Twitter. In contrast, most museums in Indonesia (both public and private museums) do not have marketing officer nor social media officer! Indonesian museums rarely use social media for promoting their programs or events. Within this paper I discuss the effectiveness of Twitter as social media marketing for museum events. As a case study I conduct research on Museum Ceria's events. Museum Ceria is an independent museum educator in Jakarta which specialized in designing public programs within museums. The result of this research could be used as recommendation for museums in Indonesia to start using social media as their marketing strategies."

    "abstract": "Open Culture Data started as a grassroots movement at the end of 2011, with the aim to open up data in the cultural sector and stimulate (creative) reuse. In this context, we organised a hackathon, which resulted in the creation of 13 Open Culture Data apps. After this successful first half year, a solid network of cultural heritage professionals, copyright and open data experts and developers was formed. In April 2012, an Open Culture Data masterclass started in which 17 institutions got practical, technical and legal advice on how to open their data for re-use. Furthermore, we organised an app competition and three hackathons, in which developers were stimulated to re-use Open Cultural Datasets in new and innovative ways. These activities resulted in 27 more apps and 34 open datasets. In this paper we share lessons-learned that will inform heritage institutions with real-life quantitative and qualitative experiences, best practices and guidelines from their peers for opening up data and the ways in which this data is reused. Since the open culture data field is still relatively young, this is highly relevant information needed to stimulate others to join the open data movement. To this end, we are already taking steps to cross the borders and let Europe know about the initiative, on both a practical and a policy level."

A project that needed a content management system - but couldn't afford to implement one. Was there a solution? In 2012 the The Institute of Contemporary Arts launched SOUNDWORKS, an online exhibition exploring over one hundred new sound works produced by artists from all over the world. In this paper, hear how the ICA and Cogapp collaborated to create a responsive, immersive and beautiful online experience with no CMS. Using modern browser technologies and social media, Cogapp created a unique and innovative stripped back interface that allowed users to explore the works in the exhibition on desktop, tablet and mobile. A special in-gallery mode also allowed visitors to the ICA to enjoy the online experience via a customised interface. Discover how we utilised SoundCloud and Twitter APIs to organise and promote the content, ensuring a constant and solid online presence. And learn how not having to implement a CMS can actually work to your advantage, increase the visibility of your content and maximise your potential within the constraints of a limited budget."

    "abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach to interrogating different online collections to identify potential matches between them, using fuzzy logic-based data-mining algorithms. Potentially, information about objects from one collection could be used to enrich records in another where there are overlaps. But although there is a considerable amount of bibliographic and other kinds of data on the Web that share similar information, a standardized way of structuring such data in a way that makes it easy to identify significant relationships does not yet exist. In the case of historical photographs, the challenge is further exacerbated by the enormous range of subjects depicted, and the fact that surviving records are not always complete, accurate, or consistent and the amount of text available per record is very small. Fuzzy-matching algorithms combined with semantic similarity techniques offer a way of finding potential matches between such items when standard ontology and corpus-based approaches are inadequate, in this case helping researchers for the first time match photographs held in different archives to historical exhibition catalogue records."

    "abstract": "Is the role of museums to curate the web as well as their own collections? How does ‘curating' as an activity relate to a digital world? This paper looks at the history of museum curation as a profession in order to understand the emergence of ‘curation' as an activity that happens outside museums in relation to a growing and hyperconnected world of digital information. It examines the source of curatorial authority in both connoisseurship and filtering, asking how that authority might be affected by in an era of abundant information and abundant human cognitive capacity, then looks at the Walker Art Center as an example of an institution that has focused its curatorial energies on the world beyond the museum. The role of algorithms as an alternative to human curation, both as personal filters and generators of public experiences is examined, and the relationship of curation to both material and digital objects questioned. It looks at how taking participative forms of curation can be taken beyond the gallery floor; how networks can enable the collaborative creation of history; and suggests that on a larger scale both algorithms and humans might contribute to an expanded museum catalogue that offers the necessary external context to museum objects. Finally, it proposes that rather than either contesting or abandoning the idea of ‘curation', museums and their curators need new approaches, tactics and skills to effectively make sense of both their own collections and the digital world."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "Using mobile technology we now have the opportunity to take artworks from the Tate collection out into the real world. Over the last year we have been developing three apps that address this in different ways – Art Maps, Pocket Art Gallery and a William Blake walking tour app. Art Maps is a mobile application and research collaboration between Tate and Horizon research centre at the Universities of Nottingham and Exeter. The project is developing and examining the use of a mobile app allowing users to relate artworks to place. Users can geo-locate artworks from Tate's online collection on a map and move, tag, comment on or annotate these, providing crowd-sourced data. They can also use the audio-visual documentation features of their smartphones to record their own responses to being in the places inspired by or depicted in the artworks. In effect they are both mapping the artworks and orientating themselves through the art, on location. We will describe the project from the perspective of the museum and from that of the users, drawing on the participant interviews from two public engagement workshops in spring and autumn 2012. We will describe how these have informed both the iterative design process as well as our emerging understanding of how and why people might want to engage with the collection in this way. Pocket Art Gallery is an augmented reality app that uses marker technology to enable people to hang artworks from the collection wherever they are in the world. The app was developed as part of the Great British Art Debate partnership project and includes artworks from Tate, as well as three other British museums. Users can select up to four artworks from a selection of one hundred paintings and can position them in their own environment, using a marker of their choice. The available markers are commonly found objects such as bank notes, road signs and logos. A user can choose to ‘hang' a famous painting in their living room through their smartphone and then take a photograph of it to share via social media or the Pocket Art Gallery map. We will describe the thinking behind the project and the challenges of using cutting-edge technology. Various choices and compromises had to made around technology platform, software licensing, choice of markers, and user experience that will give other museums plenty to consider if they're thinking about using augmented reality in this way. We are also in the process of developing a William Blake walking tour app that guides users on a walk around London, visiting locations relevant to the life of William Blake. Using geo-location services, the app will deliver rich content such as images, video or audio to the user's phone when they reach one of the locations on the tour. Our paper will explore the challenges and pitfalls as well as the successes of these projects and share the knowledge we have gained about engaging different audiences outside the gallery walls."

    "abstract": "‘Crowdsourcing' is a recent and evolving phenomenon, and the term has been broadly adopted to define different shades of public participation and contribution. Cultural institutions are progressively exploring crowdsourcing, and projects' related research is increasing. Nonetheless, few studies in the digital humanities have investigated crowdsourcing as a whole. The aim of this paper is to shed light on crowdsourcing practices in the digital humanities, thus providing insights to design new paths of collaboration between cultural organisations and their audiences. A web survey was carried out on 36 crowdsourcing projects promoted by galleries, libraries, archives, museums, and education institutions. A variety of practices emerged from the research. Even though, it seems that there is no ‘one-solution-fits-all' for crowdsourcing in the cultural domain, few reflections are presented to support the development of crowdsourcing initiatives."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "Flickr The Commons has been in operation for over four years and currently hosts the photographic collections of fifty-six cultural institutions from fourteen different countries worldwide. With the aim to show online users “hidden treasures in the world's public photography archives”, and make these collections “richer” through user input and knowledge contribution, The Commons proposes not only an alternative viewing environment from which to explore historic photographs, but also advocates an opportunity for users to contribute information and find new ways of creating meaning for photographs. But how do audiences create value and meaning for the photographs that are available within these online platforms? In particular, how does Flickr The Commons facilitate the development of these meanings? Cultural institutions can learn a great deal from the activity and behaviour of online communities of interest but in what ways can they use this information to further support these communities and make their collections more engaging and relevant for visitors and online users in the future? This paper will explore these questions by drawing on qualitative research of the Flickr The Commons activities of three participating cultural institutions and their users; the National Maritime Museum, Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums, and the Library of Congress. Through highlighting examples from interviews and action research projects undertaken at each institution, this paper argues that Flickr The Commons facilitates the development of new meaning and content around photographs through the provision of functionalities that encourage personal exploration, knowledge-sharing and re-appropriation of photographic collections. As a result, The Commons provides an opportunity for cultural institutions to re-evaluate their photographic collections in accordance with the interests and activities of the communities that use and contribute to them."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "The Australian Prints and Printmaking website (printsandprintmaking.gov.au) provides a gateway for information on printed images from Australia and Pacific region. The website contains rich data on more than 48,000 works; 20,000 artists, 8000 exhibitions, 3000 galleries and over 9000 associated references. The works are predominantly from the National Gallery of Australia's collection. Access to this vast collection has traditionally been through a search based interface. This paper will present a set of recently launched experimental interfaces that encourage open-ended exploration within this collection. These novel web based tools aim to support exploration, discovery and interpretation in this culturally significant collection. They draw upon previous work with archival and museum collections and demonstrate alternatives to the dominant search-based paradigm of collection access. These tools encourage discovery by emphasising relationships within the collection and providing displays that are denser and richer than conventional web pages. In setting out to create rich visual interfaces to a large digital collection, the project uncovers a number of challenges and considerations. It operates in a field between dynamic web design and online visualisation, where techniques and practices are still forming. A “data dense” display challenges conventions of API development, while delivering in the browser presents both opportunities and risks. This work is part of a conceptual context that Mitchell Whitelaw characterises as ‘generous interfaces'. Whitelaw argues that ‘the task-based paradigm embedded in information retrieval is increasingly out of step with our ever-more-ubiquitous, casual, and everyday experiences of information systems'. This view is shared by Marian Dörk, who introduced the ‘Information Flaneur' model as an alternative approach to task-based information seeking, one that leads to more positive information experiences. The ‘information flaneur' is able to curiously and critically move through information landscapes and creatively construct meaning as they go. The leisurely curiosity of information seeking is increasingly important and we value play and pleasure in support of engagement and discovery. Dörk, M., Carpendale, S., & Williamson, C. (2011).

    "abstract": "How do museum Web content developers persuade curatorial staff to create and publish their own dynamic content online? Although on-site visitors to the museum interact with curators through the information provided in exhibitions and public programs, there has as of yet been little effort to extend that one-way interaction between curator and visitor to embrace the more conversational form of communication common to the Web. Most exchanges between curators and the public on the Internet are highly mediated by other museum staff responsible for Web content or learning. Michael Ames (2005) of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia calls this act of anonymizing of the curatorial voice the “Wizard of Oz technique,” a communication style that implies the curator is a disembodied figure of authority with no front-facing public presence (p. 48). Several museums have attempted to encourage their curators to develop online content, mainly in the form of blogs, but as of yet there has been no systematic effort to develop a curator-specific platform to facilitate curatorial involvement online. During the conceptual phase of a complete rebuild of their outdated website (launch date April 2013), staff members of the Communications Department at the Royal BC Museum decided to be the first to address this issue of curatorial anonymity head-on by democratizing content creation across the infrastructure of the museum. Specifically, Eric Espig, a Web specialist at the museum, and Alyssa McLeod, an intern and graduate student hired as a Web developer for the Web redevelopment project, dedicated a section of the new WordPress-powered website to curator content creation, a section made up of individual staff “profile pages” to allow curators and other interested museum staff members to showcase their research interests, work processes, museum-related hobbies, and unique personalities. These profiles highlight the work of the Royal BC Museum's curatorial staff."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "This paper seeks to answer the question: How can mobile apps encourage and support meaningful, face-to-face social interaction in museum spaces? Museums are increasingly focused on creating more engaging visitor experiences, in part by encouraging participation in dialogue and social interaction in the exhibit space. At the same time, we are embracing mobile technologies. At first glance, social interaction and mobile engagement might seem to be antithetical. Many popular museum mobile apps divert visitors from interacting with exhibits, objects, and each other, undermining social interaction and dialogue. In surveying the top-rated museum apps in the iTunes store, as well as popular social apps outside the industry, we identify how apps both limit and nurture real-space social interaction. We identify key characteristics of mobile-supported social exchange, assessing which app features provide the best opportunities for fostering meaningful social interaction, both between visitors and other visitors, and between visitors and the museum. We explore specific social interactions conducive to the museum environment—game play, team work, polls, affinity-mapping, creating and sharing content, conversation prompts—and align them with mobile app features. We both analyze existing social engagement models with the greatest potential for contributing to mobile-museum projects, and identify opportunities to leverage those successful engagement models to create new types of mobile experiences."

And what if that tool, instead of being the product of a long-term, well-funded, museum-wide initiative, were built by just a few staff, in a short time, with a modest budget, using whatever tools we already have? What if the work done on a “quick and dirty” project like this could be leveraged toward future, and perhaps larger, initiatives aimed at braiding together multimedia, texts, social media, and related external resources? SFMOMA recently set out to explore these what-ifs with a prototypical publishing experiment called Story Board. Story Board is a digital hub that blends SFMOMA-produced content with a constellation of outside links, and encourages intuitive browsing. It is the first major collaborative effort of SFMOMA's newly formed Content Strategy and Digital Engagement division, which brings together Interpretive Media (formerly in Education), Community Engagement, Graphic Design, Web, and Publications. The project is intended to function as a platform for dialogue and the exchange of ideas by way of SFMOMA's social media channels and blog. The digital hub is designed to be modular, flexible, and easy to update quickly as new stories are surfaced. In this paper, we describe in depth the process of envisioning, creating and updating Story Board, from the content and production sides. We will also reflect on lessons learned from this experiment and how we have already applied them going forward."

Rijksstudio invites members of the public to create their own masterpieces by downloading images of artworks or details of artworks in the collection and using them in a creative way. The ultra high-resolution images of works, both famous and less well-known, can be freely downloaded, zoomed in on, shared, added to personal ‘studios', or manipulated copyright-free. Users can have prints made of entire works of art or details from them. Other suggestions for the use of images include creating material to upholster furniture or wallpaper, or to decorate a car or an iPad cover for example. To celebrate this digital milestone, the Rijksmuseum asked leading international artists, designers and architects to become pioneers of Rijksstudio by selecting one work from the collection and using it creatively to create a new artwork. The museum has launched a parallel campaign with a physical pop-up Rijksstudio. The campaign kicked off at the De Bijenkorf department store in major cities nationwide. A dedicated team assisted visitors in making creative products using online tools and on-site equipment such as textile printers and laser cutters. Rijksstudio will help anchor the Rijksmuseum's position in the new world of digital image culture and open design."

Digital is seen as a place for promoting the physical exhibitions and branding the institution in a positive way. But what happens if we have a crisis? Theft, fraud, and accidents are—unfortunately—also a part of the museum world, and therefore it is necessary to address such difficult issues socially. Crisis management is no longer just about “handling the press.” It is also about conversation with “likers” and followers, search engine optimization (SEO), and the production of background information, which goes beyond the traditional, written press release. We will examine and share experiences from three different situations in which social and digital crisis management became relevant to the National Museum of Denmark. In 2007, one of our national treasures was stolen. In 2011, it was discovered that a famous amber bear, believed to be prehistoric, was a modern fraud. And in 2013, one of our museums burned down."

    "abstract": "How can small-scale museums with limited resources ride the digital wave? By creating a collaboration between a group of museums and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. When public cultural institutions share skills, content and technology significant value is being created. In this paper the steps of the collaboration are explained, including the development of a series of smartphone apps for small and medium-sized museums and a shared domain, where all involved digital objects are search- and shareable. DR's strategy for the development of an open sourced “back-end” platform CHAOS: _ (Cultural Heritage Archive Open System), which serves as the backbone in DRs wish for flexible use of digital content from the heritage partners, is introduced. The creation of new content using methods from journalism, and not traditional museum communication, is described. And finally key learnings from the project are explored as identified in this phase of the project with two of the eleven future smartphone apps launched. The project shows that the smaller museums involved have come much farther than larger institutions can come alone. Together, it is possible to save money, develop the institutions, gain valuable knowledge and insight on how users want to explore valuable heritage content, and create new formats and platforms."

    "abstract": "What are visitors' motivations for using multimedia guides? What do they value most about the experience? Whitney Museum Education staff worked with Audience Focus Inc., a research and evaluation organization, to conduct an evaluation of the Whitney Biennial 2012 multimedia guide. Comprised of audio stops for adults and children, audio transcripts, and videos, the multimedia guide allowed adult visitors and children ages 8-12 to hear directly from artists as they spoke about the thoughts, processes, and ideas behind their work in the Whitney Biennial 2012 exhibition. Multiple methods were used to gather data, including questionnaires, observations, and focus group discussions that targeted different demographics. This paper shares the evaluation findings and subsequent changes made to the Whitney's multimedia guide as a result of the study. We will identify the challenges that staff face as we plan current and future mobile projects and situate our study in the context of other relevant research in the field."

    "abstract": "Wandering through museum galleries, sometimes enhanced by an audio guide or kiosk consultation, provided a suitably rich and frequently memorable experience for the 20th century museum visitor. Today, museum professionals are struggling to achieve the right balance of technology, objects and information that will provide a complete and satisfying experience for artists, scholars, visitors and museum staff alike. At least three dynamic factors are at play: 1. As technology has become increasingly powerful, its physical presence has radically diminished, along with its price, making its incorporation into museum space irresistible. 2.Visitors increasingly rely on personal digital devices to manage their understanding of the everyday world, possibly making museum-provided information devices less appealing. 3. Collection objects and artworks are made from digital materials and require digital behaviors that challenge gallery decorum and visitors expectations. Some believe museums should remain technology-free havens for a digitally-weary public, leaving the technology-rich experiences for dedicated entertainment venues. Others encourage museums to embrace the language and behavior of ubiquitous digital activity. What should museums do to support visitors experience in the 21st century? This panel of curatorial, education and media experts will debate the challenges and opportunities of incorporating digital technology into museum galleries."

    "abstract": "The Seoul Museum Association (SMA) made a new plan for the 2013 Museum Week events using the Internet and gamification techniques. The organization formed a network of 24 museums in Seoul as a single group on the Internet, and encouraged visitors to solve 24 missions at 24 venues during seven days (18th-24th May 2013). This system was established based on the seven gamification components set by Zichermann from the stage of design. This paper shows that this new concept of museum network brought many positive results. Over 1,000 people visited the museums in network and 53 people visited more than five museums, even though the participating museums were scattered all over the city. In addition, we collected over 1,000 stories from the visitors to the museums that provided players a special memory of museums in Seoul during Museum Week. Over 70% of the participating museums, moreover, wanted to use this gaming system in the future."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "Once digital images of cultural and heritage material are digitized and placed online, how can we tell if they are copied, disseminated, and reused? This paper explores Reverse Image Lookup (RIL) technologies – usually used to identify unlicensed reuse of commercial photography - to help in assessing the impact of digitized content. We report on a pilot study which tracked a sample of images from The National Gallery, London, to establish where they were reused on other webpages. In doing so, we assessed the current methods available for applying RIL, establishing how useful it can be to the cultural and heritage sectors. RIL technologies are those which allow you to track and trace image reuse online. We choose two samples of paintings from the National Gallery: all paintings held in Room 34 entitled ‘Great Britain 1750-1850', containing 26 paintings by 9 artists, just over 1% of their total number holdings (National Gallery, n.d.). We also created a random sample of 6 paintings, from different artistic periods and of varying levels of fame. We analysed the dissemination of these images using TinEye and Google Image Search, using Content Analysis (White and Marsh 2006) to discover the contexts for image reuse. We then triangulated findings using web access statistics from the National Gallery's Google Analytics account, and from the commercial ISP analysis firm Hitwise. Our results provides a qualitative analysis of types of image reuse. This study has allowed us to establish what motivates image reuse in a digital environment. We recommend a framework for data collection that could be used by other organisations. However, we also show that there are limitations to the information that can be gleaned from a study of this kind, due to the problematic implementation of the RIL tools which were not designed for this sector."

    "abstract": "The paper describes the design process and a preliminary study of a novel interface (digital booklet) for facilitating sharing of museums experiences and specifically for helping older adults to participate remotely to museum visits done by friends or relatives. We design in particular for people that for cognitive, physical, or logistic limitations are not able to visit museums, or for which it is very challenging to do so. We performed a user study with a total of 30 older adult participants, 21 in care home (10 of which with significant cognitive decline), and 9 participants in daily center (all of them without degenerative health problems). Our main hypothesis was that given the right set of tools for supporting the visitor during and after the visit we could increase sharing and reach wider audiences, including older and cognitively impaired adults. We compared the performance between healthy and cognitively impaired older adults on four tasks: open the booklet, browse the booklet, zoom in/out a picture, close the picture after being zoomed in/out. Our results showed that the booklet metaphor was well accepted by almost all the participants and they were able to consume and enjoy the content; the more complex and less intuitive functions like zooming and closing a picture were found to be more difficult for the the cognitively impaired group of participants. Our results can contribute the ongoing research in the field of interfaces for older adults and the challenge of intergenerational communication."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "Most museums try to find with different ways to prolong the museum experience outside of the museum environment and facilitate its sharing after the visit. The main reason is two-fold: it can create interest and attract people to the museum, and it can help people who for various cognitive or physical limitations cannot attend the visit, to still enjoy it. We conducted couple of surveys and we designed a possible platform for facilitating sharing, for which we report the preliminary results in this paper. Our findings show that i) although visitors claim that they would like to share their visit, the number of the actual sharing visitors is significantly low, ii) most of the visitors use only verbal narrations in order to share their experience with friends and families, and iii) visitors do not share emotions “virtually” (e.g., facebook or twitter) during the visit. Guided by these results we developed a potential solution through which sharing can be facilitated. It includes various ways to bookmark or “save” and share artifacts during the visit, catering different types of visitors. It also includes a way for people at home to consume the shared content."

    "abstract": "As a dynamic cultural organisation, the museum always has to keep pace with the times and even think ahead of them. In a fast-growing city like Hong Kong, public art museums must constantly evolve and develop in order to meet the needs of the society and anticipate the changes it undergoes. This paper introduces Oi!, the very latest contemporary art space in Hong Kong, which was established in May 2013, and examines its demonstration of a new model of public art organisation that can cater to the city's requirements. Unlike museums that are custodians of cultural legacies, Oi! positions itself as an incubator for young artistic talent, a facilitator of art creation and a project venue for engaging the community. Rather than objects of historical or artistic significance, Oi! \"collects\" creative talent and the most up-to-date information in order to help build and enhance Hong Kong's cultural software. This paper discusses how Oi! is using the Internet to connect with local artists by exploring its new online platform, \"Ignite! Hong Kong Art Portfolio Collection\". Instead of serving as an authoritative content provider like traditional museums, Oi! opens up its resources to diverse creative communities and invites them to co-curate programmes in this brand new art space with the help of the Web."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "In the world of cultural institutions, an interesting trend is emerging in the digital space. More and more museums are presenting their Web content using “responsive design.” This means that online content will be presented in different ways depending on the device on which it is being viewed. In other words, a museum's website may appear different when it is seen on a desktop versus a tablet versus a smartphone. The “responsiveness” of these designs allows online content to be more facile across today's ever-changing universe of devices. It no longer assumes a superiority of one device over another. This gives a greater breadth of creativity to museums in creating their interface, as well as their other content. Responsive design is an extraordinarily important technique for museums to embrace. This session will address three aspects of the impact of using responsive design. First, the paper will examine the core of this coding architecture. An institution must carefully examine a variety of code bases before selecting the one that best fits its needs. Second, the session will examine how people's job roles and responsibilities are impacted by the use of responsive design. In the past, people's job roles were often quite segregated from one another. Third, the session will review how the use of responsive design impacts the audience of a cultural institution. The digital space continues to grow at impressive rates. In addition, this growth occurs at a relatively rapid rate. Those who tend to rely on technology are used to devices arriving with fanfare, only to be quickly replaced with the “newer and better version.” People are not forced to choose between a smartphone, tablet, and desktop. Instead, people are invited to simply own them all. For better or for worse, responsive design teaches the audience of a cultural institution to expect a more flexible and responsive digital experience overall."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "Public-serving organizations such as museums, educational institutions, and other arts producers have in recent years embraced video as a critical medium for communication. Video provides an opportunity to serve not only our local communities, but also national and international audiences. Nonetheless, the majority of arts-related video content is distributed with only English-language audio. When this happens, we fail to serve two significant audiences: non-English speakers and the hearing-impaired. Transcription and crowdsourced translation provide the opportunity to serve these audiences, addressing issues of global access, accessibility, and community engagement. Crowdsourced translation begins with same-language transcription and captioning, which also makes content accessible to hearing impaired visitors. Community building and engagement follow, as volunteers translate the same-language transcription. Volunteers who contribute translations do so to make meaningful content accessible to their own communities; to contribute their time and expertise to an organization that they believe in; and to gain recognition for themselves. As more translated captions are published, videos become accessible to larger audiences, injecting ideas and information into new communities and building bridges between communities. The translation process also sparks a different kind of conversation amongst community managers and volunteers, discussing not only the ideas within a video, but also the particulars of language and phrasing. Contemplating ideas at the level of language offers the opportunity to gain an intimate understanding of the subject matter, generating a well-deliberated translation from a community of thinkers. This paper will explore the impact of crowdsourced translation using case studies from organizations that have either launched or are in the process of launching open translation projects. Art21, a New York-based non-profit contemporary art organization, screens its films in museums, libraries, and community centers throughout the world. Partnering with the Participatory Culture Foundation, the non-profit creators of the Amara platform, it will launch an open translation project in January 2013. The Amara toolset—which uses a community of volunteers to create and display multi-language video captioning—currently powers open translation projects at organizations such as TED, PBS NewsHour, Coursera, and the Khan Academy. Conservation Reel, a video platform funded by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, gathers videos of interest to museum and conservation professionals and students involved in conservation and collections care. The Conservation Reel team plans to combine auto-captioning and translation tools with crowdsourced mediation to deliver multilingual content to an international community of practitioners. One key goal of the project is to catalyze real-time discussion amongst far-flung members of the conservation community. To do so, it is developing tools to support better translation of user comments, hoping to extend the value of multilingual captioning by facilitating conversation around the platform's content. The presenters will outline the dramatic growth of multilingual video content online and describe current tools for producing crowdsourced translations, transcriptions, and subtitles. The presentation and paper will analyze the effects that crowdsourced captioning and translation may have upon new and existing audiences, predict future developments in crowdsourced translation, and consider the long-term potential of video translation tools for the cultural heritage community."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "This paper will explore the conceptual and methodological issues surrounding the creation of a virtual art exhibition, drawing on the experience of working on the recently launched online exhibition The Gallery of Lost Art. After a brief overview of the typologies of existing online exhibitions, the paper will review the principles underlying the creation of The Gallery of Lost Art and will underline the ways in which this project is similar to and differs from other online exhibitions. It will interrogate the concept of curation when applied to virtual spaces and digital technology, and raise questions about whether conventional museum practice can – or should – be developed and migrated to this arena. The paper will review the genesis of the project, which was a collaboration between Tate, the digital wing of the television company Channel 4 and the digital design agency ISO, and discuss how it developed into being a project with a serious art historical dimension (an exploration of the diverse ways in which important works of modern and contemporary art have disappeared or have been lost over the course of the twentieth century and how we remember these lost works). Key principles underlying the project will be reviewed. First among these was the decision to create an immersive experience (as opposed to a flat, image-plus-text presentation) rich in the associations of visiting a gallery space (albeit in this case something closer to a warehouse space). Second, we chose to bring curatorial values and practices to this project with a view to developing an exhibition that a conventional museum visitor, rather than, for example, someone seeking information from a museum website, could potentially enjoy. These values and practices included a sensitivity to the scale and physical qualities of the lost artworks (and the documents through which their existence was traced), a refusal to create surrogates for the lost artworks, and the provision of a complex and challenging thesis through the selection of forty case studies. The third determining principle was the decision to allow the project to end after one year, mimicking the situation with museum exhibitions. This has proved controversial, with some surprise and indeed criticism being expressed at the idea of allowing what has been seen as a valuable educational resource to be 'lost'. The paper will explore these decisions and their consequences for the conceptualisation of an online art exhibition. It will ask whether this sort of project, which was conceived and developed as a curatorial rather than a learning project, offers a model with potential for significant future development for art museums that are seeking to connect with audiences who that may not normally consider visiting a conventional exhibition or are geographically remote. It will also look at the difficulties of locating an art historical thesis within a sphere that is not normally seen as having an impact on art historians, and the positives brought to the project about history and memory by the digital terrain."

    "abstract": "‘What we need is a hybrid, a fusion of the critical stance of cultural theory with the constructive attitude of the visual designer. This new media critic that we are imagining wants to make something, but what she wants to make will lead her viewers or readers to reevaluate their formal and cultural assumptions'. - Bolter, J. D. (2004) “Theory and Practice of New Media Studies” On the 25th April 2012 the University of Ulster hosted a hack day in the Ulster Museum for students on the Interactive Media Arts BA (hons) and Museum Studies MA, this event saw students develop innovative interactive experiences within the context of a traditional museum setting. Students worked in teams with mentors to develop playful ludic interactions which worked with (and sometimes against) the museum's collections and displays. The interactive experiences that students developed are designed to question the notion of play in the museum, recontextualising the collections and gallery spaces to create new modes for the public to investigate and interrogate the spaces of the museum as an institution and develop new dialogues with the exhibits. These ‘experiences' act as a tangible example of how time constrained prototyping can facilitate innovative responses to museum collections and presents a case for museums to develop and implement interactive experiences in a faster and more efficient manner. The Hack Day marked the culmination of ‘This is our Playground' a semester long collaborative research project which explored interdisciplinary teaching and practice, through a series of workshops on digital literacy and designing for the cultural sector. As a result of this project National Museums Northern Ireland has begun to explore new ways to engage with students, and is in the process of developing an interactive media project that will build on the outcomes produced during the Hack Day. This paper will: Demonstrate the potential benefits of moving away from internships and workshops with defined outcomes and moving towards a model of engagement which asks students ‘what's possible?' Make a case for museums to develop stronger R&D and skill share partnerships with students at local universities, and outline possible approaches that would allow museums to benefit from the skills, knowledge and experience of students from a wide range of design, media, and creative technologies courses. Showcase some of the most successful projects that the students created and demonstrate that an inter-disciplinary approach and guerrilla dialogue with museum spaces can encourage new audiences and creative responses, encouraging a new sense of ownership for the developers and their audiences. Key takeaways: Delegates will gain practical insights into new ways of working with University/ Higher Education students. This will help attendees develop a solid understanding of how they could facilitate partnerships that would generate cutting edge R&D and low budget approaches to skill sharing between museum staff and students."

    "abstract": "The September 2012 design issue of Wired magazine features the new Makerbot 3D printer on its cover, with the headline “This Machine will Change the World.” Will it? The dialogue of participatory and collaborative production must be revisited as new technologies make physical design and construction accessible to the general public. The emergence of a 3D production ecosystem that is broadly accessible both in cost and ease of use makes this technology of particular and immediate interest to museums. There are multitudes of opportunities for 3D scanning and printing. Models of museum objects can take on a creative life of their own through further derivation, by becoming parts of new collections of things or by being connected through programming and sensors. By the very nature of the name, Museums and the Web has explored how the Internet can be used to further the missions of our museums. 3D printing adds a new parallel dimension by rematerializing the Web in small plastic forms. The paper documents and explores how 3D printing and scanning can be used to help our audiences feel the museum."

    "abstract": "Exposing collection data for harvesting is challenging for cultural institutions, more so when the “standard” data schema is in transition during the project. The Yale Center for British Art (YCBA) encountered this challenge as it worked towards exposing collection data in the CDWA Lite schema using the OCLC Museum Data Exchange (MDE), open source tools. Concurrent with the YCBA project, CDWA Lite was superseded by the LIDO schema, offering the YCBA opportunity to use the more robust LIDO schema, and the challenge to find appropriate software. Identifying an absence of LIDO tools, the YCBA choose to extend the MDE project CDWA Lite tools to support the LIDO schema, and in the process developed efficient software for exposing data in the LIDO schema. This paper is a digital road trip documenting the YCBA project from the collection cataloging decisions to using the YCBA developed 2nd generation MDE tools to expose collection data in the LIDO schema."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "Museums are increasingly looking at ways to join up the in museum experience with the online experience, taking the museum experience beyond the boundaries of the physical building and allowing online visitors into the museum. Web Lab is, we believe, the first complete exhibition that does this. A series of five physical installations (experiments) are located in Web Lab at the Science Museum. Visitors in the museum an online can interact together with these physical installations. Online visitors like museum visitors interact and control real physical exhibits at the Science Museum. Once the museum closes its doors the whole experience is turned over to the online visitors, creating a true 24 hour museum experience. As well as controlling the exhibits online visitors can see what is happening via Web Lab's many webcams. Every visitor to the exhibition, online and in the museum, is represented by a “Lab Tag”: a visual code that can be scanned at each experiment to let users keep track of their activity. Visitors can collect the artifacts that they make at each experiment and view them, again using the “Lab Tag”, when they get home. Developed by Google and friends from the Science Museum London, Tellart, B-Reel, Fraser Randall, UDS and Bibliothèque. Web Lab is a new kind of museum experience. Open to visitors from around the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Whether in the Museum or online the experiments are controlled through a browser. Everything in Web Lab is written in HTML5 and pushes current web technologies about as far as they will go. The team faced many challenges bringing Web lab to life. This paper will look at the development and installation of Web Lab and how visitors both at the Science Museum and online have responded to this ground breaking exhibition."

The prioritization process and resource allocation was both energizing and agonizing, touching a broad array of possible technologies, and an equally diverse range of attitudes held by stakeholders about what usage should be supported. Initially, free wireless offerings include the Art Institute of Chicago Tours app with turn-by-turn wayfinding support which is achieved by leveraging indoor positioning services. Wi-Fi as a utility opens the future up for other content delivery and of course, full access to social media channels. This article provides a window on what decisions were been made, what went into those deliberations, what has been deployed, and indications of future developments."

It has drawn in equal parts from the traditional work ethic of the American Southwest and new technology-enabled forms of collaboration to develop a cultural technology program that encompasses academics, internships, and research and development, based on long-term, sustainable partnerships. CCT provides a replicable and adaptable model for meeting a major challenge faced by museums and the academic programs that prepare students for employment in them. The challenge: addressing the growing demands for new technological skill sets. By providing students with access to practical and affordable technological and design solutions, the partnership structure promotes the use of technology by New Mexico's cultural institutions. By paving the way for career paths for students traditionally excluded because of socio-economic status, geography, and ethnicity, CCT is helping diversify the museum workforce. By generating community goodwill and making a positive impact on recruitment and retention, CCT has raised the stature of NMHU."

    "abstract": "What's the difference between the aspiration and the reality of digital innovation? How much can you actually achieve under the umbrella of R&D? How experimental can you be across multiple platforms when time, resource and funding are against you? These are questions that all museums are now facing and questions which the Social Interpretation project at The Imperial War Museums (IWM) has been trying to tackle head on. The Social Interpretation project (SI) at IWM is utilising R&D and innovative practice to fundamentally challenge the way in which museums interact with, and provide for, audiences. The aim being to rebalance the authority / audience divide; turning museums into social, participatory organisations – with all the challenges this entails. With this paper, we would like to share our experiences and the findings from this national project, focusing on reflections on R&D and innovative processes used to engage audiences and the implications for the use of digital technology that encourages participatory communication and content creation by visitors. In particular we will discuss the challenges of implementing participatory digital innovation projects in museums and the impact this has not only on visitors but also on the institution as a whole. Although this paper will concentrate on technology and concepts created for IWM, issues of R&D and digital innovation are applicable to any museum."

    "url": "https://mw2013.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/the-virtual-leopold-fleischhacker-museum",
    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "The German-Jewish sculptor and artist Leopold Fleischhacker (1882-1946) created busts, medallions, insignias, monuments, memorial tablets (Brocke, 1988) and more than 250 tombstones located in cemeteries in the German Rhine-Ruhr area (Steinheim Institute, 2011). The Steinheim-Institut and Prof. Dr. Michael Brocke are the owners of the Fleischhacker estate, which includes more than 300 annotated photographs and personal letters, comprising work between 1908 and 1938. The majority of Fleischhacker's artworks were destroyed or are scattered in private collections and are no longer accessible. Thus, the Steinheim-Institut decided to develop a virtual museum depicting the life and work of Leopold Fleischhacker. The web-based museum is a combination of indoor and outdoor areas to gather and share the pictorial material and 3D reconstructions of still extant tombstones in thematically oriented exhibitions. The exhibited material provides an insight into Fleischhacker's private life and an overview of his artworks and artistic styles. The museum hosts approximately 200 pictorial exhibits; 3D assets and information tableaus; 29 reconstructed tombstones; and one greatly enlarged reconstruction of a signet, which serves as eye-catcher in the entrance hall of the virtual museum. Art history contexts, exhibition design, texts and room arrangements were elaborated by Dr. Barbara Kaufhold. The virtual exhibition will be thematically arranged throughout 14 exhibition rooms. The conceptual exhibition layout was drafted into ground plot sketches to indicate the spatial design and to define virtual object positions. Our demonstration seeks to present the interdisciplinary development of the Virtual Leopold Fleischhacker Museum's interior rooms: the digitization of Fleischhacker's pictorial estate, metadata capturing and descriptive metadata enrichment and the automated process of transforming ground plot sketches into virtually walk able 3D exhibition rooms. Due to the large set of pictorial exhibits we utilize the advantages of metadata based modeling–automated generation of exhibition rooms and automatic distribution of exhibits for further manual postprocessing (Sacher et al., 2012)–as well as the curator software suite ViMEDEAS (Virtual Museum Exhibition Designer using an Enhanced ARCO Standard), which has already been described in (Biella and Luther, 2009), (Biella et al., 2010b), (Biella et al., 2010a) and (Biella et al., 2012). ViMEDEAS is designed for museum curators and content creators and for (3D) software developers, as well as for visitors, researchers and educators alike. ViMEDEAS includes authoring tools, frameworks, an XML-based metadata set to describe virtual museums and seeks to support the entire design process of virtual museums: planning, creation, archiving, dissemination and presentation. The metadata set ViMCOX (Virtual Museum and Cultural Object Exchange Format) (Wolf et al., 2012), which is included in ViMEDEAS, describes virtual museums containing classical, contemporary or born-digital art. ViMCOX was developed to support the hierarchical description of virtual museums and provides stylistic devices for sophisticated and vivid exhibition design, which cannot be achieved using classic museums standards. ViMCOX supports interactive exhibition content, assets, outdoor areas and spatial exhibition design including illumination concepts. The metadata set ViMCOX is based on international metadata standards and uses LIDO version 1.0 (Coburn et al., 2010) as an interchange and harvesting format for cultural objects."

    "author": "Rachel Sargent",
    "url": "https://mw2013.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/building-cybercabinets-guidelines-for-online-access-to-digital-natural-history-collections",
    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "Natural history is deeply important to a wide range of human endeavors, yet access to such knowledge is at an all-time low for the general public. In the age of the Internet, engaging the public online is critical to building audiences and broadening support for natural history, yet online access to collections is currently an under-utilized tool for promoting public appreciation of natural history. This research examines ways natural history can be effectively and creatively presented online to the public and culminates in offering eight guidelines aimed at supporting development decisions for natural history web initiatives. The guidelines are supported by research reviewing relevant literature, analyzing six model sites with an heuristic evaluation tool and a user survey, and exploring three case studies in depth by interviewing key project personnel. The heuristic analysis was designed using trends identified in the digital collections literature, and incorporating ideas from Internet epistemologists which are often overlooked in museum dialogue. User survey data was drawn from three groups: high school students, teachers, and professional adults and reveals their preference patterns. The case studies range from a well-established online collections portal to an in-progress pilot data mash up project and reveal how superficially disparate projects can share underlying philosophies. The eight guidelines cover issues ranging from design considerations to project philosophies. The first recommendation is to be useful, which includes incorporating simplicity of design, findability, and deep content into any web project. The second guideline is to be beautiful. A beautiful site will win over visitors even if they have little prior interest in natural history and have never heard of the host institution. The third lesson is keep it personal, since users engage more with websites that allow them to personalize their experiences. The fourth guideline is to provide serendipity by supporting unexpected discoveries on the part of users. The fifth guideline is to share. Sharing through open access and linking between sites as one of the primary advantages of the Internet and promotes user trust, online community building, and creative content re-use. The sixth recommendation is to encourage participation by thinking of online access as an on-going dialogue with site users. The seventh guideline is to provide access to experts, one of the primary resources users are looking for when they turn to museum sites. The final guideline is to collaborate across institutional boundaries. When institutions share through collaboration, their pooled resources become a richer source of content. The goal behind these guidelines is to promote creative online access to natural history collections aimed at a public audience. Natural history museums have barely begun to plumb the potential of the Internet for reaching diverse audiences to advocate for nature and the environment. The public needs access to natural history as much as ever, presenting collections online is supported by a growing body of research, and natural history museums can take advantage of the new networked knowledge ecology on the Internet to create \"cybercabinets\" of digital natural history specimens."

    "abstract": "In a world in which museums are frequently seen as stuffy and formal, cultural organizations are in a fight for the public's leisure-time attention. While informal learning spaces like museums are broadly appreciated as a “good” thing, the 2010 census survey on Adult Participation In Leisure Activities reports that only 14.5% of US Adults visited museums in the prior 12 months (Census, 2012). It's not surprising then that the topics of Audience Engagement and Participatory Culture have garnered a lot of attention in the field of museums recently. Following Henry Jenkins' publication on the topic (2006), many contemporaries in museums have expanded on the impact these ideas are having on museum practice. (Simon 2010)(Richardson 2011)(Stein 2012)(Mack, et al 2012) This paper will discuss the Dallas Museum of Art's approach of establishing a digital platform for museum engagement called DMA Friends that attempts to structure and measure the repeat engagement of visitors with the Museum and its programs. The paper will share the underlying approach in design of the Friends program, some technical detail about the implementation, and some significant initial findings from the project launch in January 2013."

    "abstract": "User testing played a key role in the development of the Tate's website in 2012. While the web analytics can show us how users come onto our websites and how they are using it, the user testing helps us see real users in action, understand why they are using it the way they do and in turn help us identify where the improvements to the usability and performance could be made. This workshop will be useful to those considering outsourcing user testing as it will give them a head start in planning for user testing, what they can expect and should be demanding from their suppliers. The workshop comes in two parts. In the first part, the participants will get an overview of the user testing practice in general, what it is and why it is important. They will also hear about the user testing conducted as part of the Tate's website relaunch in 2012, covering topics such as balancing user needs against business goals, recruiting users and asking the right questions, and putting the findings into action. In the second part, the participants will get their sleeves up and their hands dirty and get involved in practical tasks of planning for a user testing session. They will try their skills in brief writing, defining user testing objectives and personas, as well as the practicalities of carrying out the user testing and taking actions based on the results. The aim of this workshop is to learn in a fun and engaging way about user testing and equip participants with the basic knowledge to be able to commission user testing from external agencies or do it themselves."

An interactive wireless avatar, Mr. Steam, a 3D virtual character, narrates a story and interacts with the school children following the themes of time, travel and space, using the history of trains from the age of steam locomotives to the present day. Visitors interact by means of a wireless video controller. The video was made in two languages (Portuguese and English) and subtitles can be used for accessibility. The avatar has a camcorder that alows another interaction with printed cards bearing symbols, called \"magic cards.\" Children can see different trains in 3D models as if they were in their hands. They can join carriages with the locomotives and make them move, they can understand the different speeds of the trains like a TGV (Hight Velocity Train) or a diesel locomotive, or see the inside of a carriage. This project was made possible through the co-finance program, START-Seamless Travel across the Atlantic area Regions using sustainable Transport."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "The Hong Kong Maritime Museum would have approximately two years to plan its expansion from an older site that contained two galleries to a new one that had fifteen. New galleries would have to be created. The collection would have to be moved. The museum would close its doors to the public for twelve months, and the only public presence would be the museum's website. The website would have to be reengineered and restructured for more dynamic content. This meant in part increasing photos of collection items and adding historic films. The strategy at hand was to create an online gallery for each of the fifteen sponsored spaces. Each online gallery would introduce the public to the theme of the gallery and profile the individual or company that was sponsoring it. Ideally, each online gallery would include photos of the highlighted collection items that would be on display. The public would be encouraged to follow the progress of the museum's construction and learn more about the new gallery themes. Since the CMS could not serve as the dataset for the collection, other options had to be explored. In the end, the museum turned to flickr as a way to host its online collection photos. By utilizing flickr's application program interface, multi-level category sets, tags, and hypertext fields, the museum created its first online collection. And later, when the museum launched its new website, the flickr dataset was used to populate the new content. This paper will explore the strategies the museum faced in creating a dynamic online collection."

    "abstract": "Museums in Finland operate as a network with a centralized management for collections and administration due to the moderate size of their buildings, collections, exhibitions, and numbers of visitors. This network provides a good base to develop a mobile tool for the purpose of audience outreach and exhibition mediation, which are presently weak in the mobile and web environment. This paper concludes the first part of an ongoing research project in the analysis of the conditions for developing such a tool, describing the conditions and verifying the hypothesis that a distributed mobile guide app platform as a tool would attract more visitors to museums and better facilitate museum communication. The first task has been to deal with the existing literature and public archives. The second task has been to describe the prototypes in information architecture, in-app features as GPS, interactive maps, links to social media, etc. The third task has been carried out as a front-end evaluation and with suggested business models, knowing that a thorough app user experience study combined with a museum visitor behavior study as a second part of the research project will later be able to provide more complete insight."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "In 2011/12 the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA) underwent a AUD$53 million redevelopment. The building works included the refurbishment of all galleries and offices, the addition of a new 5-story wing and two new rooftop venues. At the same time as the physical building was closed for redevelopment, from August 2011 to March 2012, the Museum's digital infrastructure was also being refurbished and, in many cases, replaced. The MCA took this opportunity to look at its systems for ticketing, store point-of-sale, customer relationship management, membership, donations and the MCA website. The Museum also sought to add online ticketing, online membership, online donations, an online store and a museum-wide WiFi network. This paper and talk outlines how we created an entirely new eCommerce framework using web APIs to connect open systems for ticketing, store, philanthropy and membership. It argues that in many cases, and especially for under-resourced cultural institutions, a selection of loosely coupled best-of-breed systems (preferably via open APIs) is preferable to attempting to build or buy an \"all in one\" solution. Further, the talk will discuss how this approach can be extended and applied in other institutional contexts."

    "abstract": "Museum professionals create narratives that tell stories about museum objects and across museum objects. Narratives are not limited to the physical exhibition, but include also catalogues, audio tours, educational materials and web sites. In this paper we will describe Storyscope, a web-based environment for the construction of museum narratives, which links a final narrative to the underlying story and plot, thus allowing end-users the ability to see the thought-processes of the curator and to develop their own personalised narratives. We focus on the reasoning processes embedded into Storyscope that support a narrative author in story building by proposing additional events, and relations between events, for developing a plot of the story. Intelligent support also draws on notions of dramatic narrative to suggest ways of narrating a story and plot eliciting different types of reader response."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "Mobile apps are the natural evolution of the traditional audio tour, enabling visitors to self-guide around the galleries of museums. Rich content is at the heart of most museum experiences, but this pattern of engagement follows the traditional one-way communication model of museums, with the visitor a passive participant in their pursuit of understanding. In 2011 the High Museum of Art, working with Second Story Interactive Studios, set a goal of social engagement with their visitors, looking to create an app that was not only informative, but also made visitors a fundamental part of the experience. Leveraging natural user behavior and incorporating image recognition, the mobile app has been a huge success for the museum. In this paper, we present ArtClix as a case study for effective social engagement by the museum through novel uses of technology. We share the initial conceptual work in developing the application, the technical hurdles encountered along the way, and the resulting evaluation work across multiple exhibits."

    "year": "2013",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a forthcoming online catalogue of Chinese painting and calligraphy in the collection of the Seattle Art Museum (SAM). This online scholarly catalogue is the result of five years of planning, research, and experimentation under the auspice of the J. Paul Getty Foundation. This proposal summarizes the processes by which SAM selected a modest and largely unpublished collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy, and thought through the needs and functionalities of the catalogue. This catalogue will present an innovative way for studying and presenting classical Chinese painting and calligraphy. During the course of the project, SAM's collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy grew substantially, adding significant works of the Ming and Qing dynasties as well as from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Their importance led to the conclusion that the new acquisitions should be constantly added in the catalogue. Therefore, the active acquisition program led to a fundamental change in our expectation of the function of the online ‘catalogue,' namely that it should be a portal of new scholarship and new acquisitions. This online catalogue features thoughtful and provocative essays about major works by renowned professors and curators in the United States and Asia, with high-resolution, zoom-able images of the works of art, and thorough documentation—including transcriptions and translations of inscriptions and colophons, and seals that are transcribed, identified, and located. Readers are encouraged to post comments about the works of art and the accompanying essays, as well as to formulate answers to questions that we put forward under the section “Questions for Thought.” By the time of the conference, the catalogue will have had a three-month trial period, and we will be able to report on its reception by the scholarly community. We expect to address issues of maintenance and sustainability of the online catalogue with colleagues."

The project experiments by creating a hybrid exhibition space allowing the visitors to interact with archive documents without touching the authentic physical objects. The visitor is allowed to experiment with a 3D digital copy through an augmented board in an immersive virtual environment. The Mubil laboratory was established in June 2011 as an interdisciplinary cooperation between the NTNU University library the Norwegian University of Science and technology, with Letizia Jaccheri professor at the department of Computer Science of the NTNU university and Chiara Evangelista from the Percro laboratory of the University of Santa Anna in Pisa Italy. Starting in October 2011 the project MUBIL has been developing a pilot and the information collected through the interaction with the users will be analysed in order to create a laboratory application by the NTNU university library and promote its special archives. We hope to go further than 3D recontructions where the user remains a passive viewer. We aim to find ways in creating an active participation in an immersive environment that stimulates knowledge seeking through a perception-action interaction procedure. A working laboratory is being created in a hybrid environment (physical and immersive) and the experiment has a clear educational objective: to test the learning outcome of the users. The application will also be accessible through the Internet. During this event we intend to demonstrate our work and get feedback by others that might have been working with such  projects."

    "title": "Evaluating the Practical Applications of Eye Tracking in Museums",
    "author": "Ed Bachta, Robert Stein, Silvia Filippini Fantoni, Tiffany Leason",
    "url": null,
    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "Museum professionals spend a significant amount of time studying the ways that visitors engage with objects in their collections to improve the quality of interaction with them. Focus groups at the Indianapolis Museum of Art and elsewhere indicate that visitors see art museums as places for “inspiration” and “contemplation;” however, visitors are observed to spend very little time actually looking at art. Obtaining a more concrete understanding of what aspects of a visit are found to be inspiring, and how museums can actively promote and encourage those experiences remain some of the field's biggest challenges. In thinking creatively as to how to address these problems, the authors began to explore whether recent advances in eye tracking technology might hold some answers. Techniques for measuring gaze have been an important part of cognitive psychology since the early 1960's. Environmental scans by Rayner (1998) summarize the scope and evolution of research linking eye tracking and cognition. Agreement in the research suggests that gaze and attention are tightly coupled (Hoffman 98) implying a direct relationship between the way we look at museum objects and our thinking about them. Research by Wooding (2002) examines the use of eye tracking systems and art from the collection of the National Gallery in London. While the data seems promising, Wooding's work focused more on a generalized method for visualizing eye tracking data and not on specific applications of these techniques for art history or museology. Milekic (2010) published an overview of gaze tracking and its potential applications for museums, highlighting the coming advent of cheap and commercially available equipment to support the use of these tools in a museum setting. Funded by an IMLS Sparks! Ignition grant, the Indianapolis Museum of Art is exploring whether or not eye tracking technology can be useful to museums seeking to better understand how in-gallery visitors actually “see” the objects in our collection. Through a set of three experiments, the project seeks to understand whether eye tracking can be used to measure visitor attention to artworks, understand the correlation between guided interpretation and visitor comprehension, and to trigger interpretive content delivery. In this paper, authors will review the relevant literature in the field that connects gaze detection and cognition; explain in detail the experimental methodology used to determine the practicality of adopting these techniques in museums; and report in initial conditions and factors discovered during the project's initial research.

    "abstract": "Games, and game-like experiences, are becoming increasingly important to museums seeking to engage new audiences and to provide deeper engagement with existing audiences. Demonstrating the value of commissioning and producing games as a core activity of museums is imperative. At the same time, the sector is encountering a new, cold wave of realism in evaluating its online presences. Old canards about new audiences are being thrown out the window, and a more rigorous focus is being applied to the business of gaining and measuring audience attention. There is a risk, however, that these engagement metrics, oriented towards page-based content and measurable proxies for interaction in social media are poorly suited for the kind of immersive, deep engagement that good games can offer. This paper will identify and discuss best practice in the field of museum games evaluation in order that such evaluation might also move towards standardisation and wide acceptance, with the end result of improving games in our field. Most museum games are web-based, and have an explicit educational intent. Examples from our own experience include High Tea, Memory (Wellcome Collection), Launchball, Rizk and Thingdom (Science Museum). These types of games will be the focus of this paper, though we expect the methodology to have applications across other gaming activities. Drawing from our own institutional practices, across the cultural heritage and informal learning sectors, and looking at the area of 'persuasive' games in general, we will focus on initial objective setting and three areas of evaluation: 1. Quantitative evaluation: What are the best tools and methods to measure overall interactions, in-game interactions, and profile game achievement against audience segments? 2. Qualitative evaluation: How can we use interviews, surveys, and focus groups to gain a deeper understanding of player motivation and experience and are they sufficient? Can we find more useful and rich 'in the wild' where people freely discuss games? If we choose that route, what are the best approaches to gathering and analyzing that data? 3. Pre vs Post-release evaluation: How reliable or valid are expert reviews and user testing of games prior to release? How do these results compare with those from summative evaluations? In each of these areas, we will also consider aligning evaluation approaches for different types of games: autonomous games, and gamified or gameful experiences. Technical appendices will describe both quantitative and qualitative methods."

    "abstract": "This demonstration will focus on the questions \"What kind of Social Media and Social Software have already been used for Museum Education Services on-line?\" and \"How do German Museums use the Social Web to enhance their Museum Education Services?\" In Europe museums are places of education and learning (e.g. DEUTSCHER MUSEUMSBUND (Ed.), 2009). Participation, visitor engagement, self-organized and collaborative learning represent keywords mentioned in relation to museum education. Social Media include specific characteristics that can help to guarantee different kinds of participatory learning opportunities to make museum learning self-organized, engaging and community-friendly. On-line learning is still an exception in the German Museum World, and therefore the gap between the presentation of general information like address and phone number and an educational service using Social Media to engage audiences is still large (INSTITUT FÜR MUSEUMSFORSCHUNG (Ed.), 2008, WWW, 55).[1] The Internet is basically used for public relations (PÖRSCHMANN, 2003, WWW, 1) and Social Media are mostly utilized for marketing reasons, i.e. posting general information concerning events and other press releases to advertise activities of the real museum's site. German examples for Museum Education Services on the Internet and the use of Social Media will show the state-of-the-art of on-line education and learning within the German museum field.

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "A growing number of museums have begun to seize upon the possibilities of Quick Response (QR) codes linked to electronic records and multimedia as a way to augment in-gallery information. QR codes seem to provide museums with a simple and accessible way of providing additional in situ information about objects. However, access does not necessarily lead to engagement. This paper documents an augmented reality art intervention that used QR codes linked to digital captions to expose both the flawed nature of museum classification, and the potentially alienating effect of technology in the museum context. Called Classify Me2.0, the museological work, which won the 2011 Watt Space Gallery Art Prize and responded to the Art Prize theme Classify Me, was a form of trompe l'oeil curating, a term coined by America artist Fred Wilson to mean meta-museology.  The artist assigned classification to all works of art entered into the Prize, exposing vital problems inherent in the categorisation of museum objects. This was a critical undertaking because, as Ken Arnold writes, \"taxonomy and classification have for almost three centuries been the most powerful way by which knowledge has been created and then reinterpreted within museums.\"[1] The artist then used QR codes linked to electronic records to display these classifications proximate to the works themselves, making it possible for visitors with enabled smart phones to consider the classification of object in situ with the objects themselves. However, the QR codes were visually unengaging and difficult to 'read'. Prior to exhibition, the Gallery Director decided that no explanation of how to use QR codes in the Gallery space, meaning that only those already familiar with the technology were really enabled to interact with the work. The classification website could be accessed via a computer on site, but it too was difficult to engage with. Few visitors to the exhibition utilised either technology to connect with the work. By winning an art show with a museological critique Classify Me2.0 provoked controversy in the local arts community. However, it also exposed serious complexities and flaws inherent in museum classification, and demonstrated clear barriers to access of technology in the museum context if not fully integrated into supporting documentation. This paper will document the issues it raised about classifications, QR codes and technology.   [1] Arnold, Ken. Cabinets for the Curious: Looking Back at Early English Museums.

    "abstract": "Tate has been producing and running Online Courses for three years with the launch of the Artists Techniques and Methods Course in 2008 and a second Introduction to Drawing Techniques Course in 2010. There are over 1500 registered users on the Tate Online courses, many of them based outside the UK. The courses are based upon a unique model of trying to provide the equivalent of an online evening class rather than an accredited course. Each course consists of six tutorial units which are accompanied by a discussion forum and an image gallery. The course units are highly interactive and contain a lot of video and animation. The courses are designed to be informal and practical so that students can learn about techniques, try them out at home and then share the results with other students on the discussion forum and in the image gallery.  Once a user has signed up to the course they have unlimited access to the course environment so they can spend as long as they like studying the material and can re-visit the course over a long timeframe. The demonstration of the online courses will provide a unique opportunity for museum professionals to have a look at the Tate Online courses without having to pay for them. The demonstration will also examine how to create a business model for producing and running online courses so that they generate revenue for your museum. The courses were developed using Moodle (a free open source LMS) and an inexpensive authoring tool called Articulate. The demonstration will show how tools such as these can be used to create online courses incorporating new or existing content, including video, animation and images. The Tate online courses were created on a very low budget, often re-using content that had been created for other projects. I will discuss how to build up an online community of learners and the benefits and disadvantages of providing an online tutor. I will also share the user research Tate has carried out to discover what students look for in an online course and which course features and formats work best with this user group."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "Introduction Traditionally, the focus of online museum collections has been to facilitate access and discovery for subject category experts seeking information about objects in the collection (Rayward & Twidale, 1999). Today, museums observe an increasing number of 'untrained eyes' visiting their online collections to browse or search art collections for intrinsic enjoyment and leisure (Marty, Sayre, & Fantoni, 2011; Packer, 2010). Research by the Steve.museum social tagging project has demonstrated that the language used by novice visitors to describe works of art differs significantly from that descriptive metadata used by museums to describe the same collections (Trant, 2009). Many visitors to museums' online collections seek experience-centered online experiences that can be fun and pleasurable, rather than a suite of advanced features. However, most of today's online collections do not fully support such an experience-centered environment. A quick survey could show that these systems lack not only functionality, but also the appropriate affective and hedonic aspects necessary to support such an experience (Blythe, Wright, McCarthy, & Bertelsen, 2006). It is necessary to take holistic approaches for online museum experiences, which go beyond accessibility and functionality, to address the aspects of emotional interaction (Johnson, Gardner, & Wiles, 2004).      Research Outline Using the online collection of the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA), this study seeks to design and implement an affective online search and retrieval system for visitors who may have general interests in art, but may not know where to start.  Techniques from the affective computing literature will be applied to develop an affective embedded agent that can recognize and respond to the users' expressed emotions and preferences. Social tagging tools will be used to record the visitors' subjective views and interests in arts. These social tags will inform the affective agent and allow it to interact with visitors based on this information. Because the proposed agent uses interactive techniques to incorporate the users' emotions and preferences during the image retrieval process, the untrained online visitors can easily refine their interests about art collections and map those interests to terminology and metadata maintained by the museum. As such, online visitors do not need to be subject matter experts with knowledge in art historical terminology to navigate art collections; an enjoyable browsing experience can be created to support visitors' known and unknown preferences. This study can contribute to the field of museum technology by providing empirical guidelines on how an affective agent can be designed and influence the internal state of a person to improve overall museum experience in an online setting.   Conclusion When combined with user-generated social tags, an embedded agent can be a powerful search method that provides 'general-purpose question-answering capabilities' in the context of online museums (Etzioni, 2011). We hope our research serves to broaden our understanding of the role that emotions play in use of search and retrieval systems by novices, and that it will provide useful guidelines for the online museum community in studying interactions with systems that are intelligent and sensitive to online visitors' emotions and preferences.   References Blythe, M., Wright, P., McCarthy, J., Bertelsen, O.

    "abstract": "For over 100 years RCAHMS has been charged with recording, interpreting and sharing information on the built heritage of Scotland. In recent years the institution has been involved in a number of online initiatives, both independently and in partnership with other organizations. This paper reports on findings from doctoral research conducted between 2008 and 2012 at the University of Edinburgh's School of Education, in partnership with RCAHMS, which investigated the institution's approach to digital innovation and online practices. The paper also offers an institutional perspective on how the research has fed into RCAHMS' digital strategy, and reports on recent online initiatives which embody the institution's vision. The collaborative research project involved an ethnographic study of RCAHMS and a virtual ethnography of its digital archive Canmore, re-launched in 2009 with enhanced user functionalities. These include the ability for the public to contribute original material in the form of images, data and comments; public engagement with the archive is further supported through a link with the photo-managing site Flickr, where user-contributed photographs are stored. The paper examines different types of user contributions to Canmore in the first year since its launch, and reflects on participation patterns, which are also contrasted with experiences on The Commons on Flickr, another important example of collaboration between heritage institutions and the successful social media site. Different models of online engagement with cultural heritage content are then discussed involving, respectively, granting access to public collections on institutional websites versus allowing the release of material onto mature social media sites. Implications of the different approaches are examined in terms of institutional practice, users and content, in relation to RCAHMS and cultural heritage practice more widely.  From RCAHMS' perspective, the paper reports on how participation in the research project offered the opportunity to focus attention on digital innovation at various levels within the institution, and how follow-up AHRC Beyond Text funding secured the scoping and implementation of further online developments consistent with RCAHMS' new strategic vision.Two current projects in particular embody such vision: Scotland's Places, in which RCAHMS is working with the National Records of Scotland and the National Library of Scotland to create an expanding online 'Heritage Hub'; and the collaborative project Britain from Above, with English Heritage and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, in which social media will be demonstrated as being an integral part of future online strategies. The paper concludes with a mention of Digital Futures of Cultural Heritage Education, a recent project funded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, through which RCAHMS and the University of Edinburgh, in partnership with the National Galleries of Scotland and National Museums Scotland, set out to create a forum to share expertise, encourage collaboration and set a common research agenda for digital innovation in the Scottish cultural heritage sector."

Although many of the buildings still have no meaning metadata this is seen as a valuable opportunity to encourage increased participation and individual stewardship of one or more buildings. This paper will discuss the motivation behind the project, it's technical implementation and shortcomings as well as future directions. It will also address the increasingly number and role of community-driven bespoke registries of cultural artifacts and the fact the Internets make it possible for people to self-organize around a common interest, effectively collapsing the costs usually associated with production and distribution, and if communities of amateurs don't feel like they have any avenues to participate in established projects, or institutions, then they can and will just do it themselves.

    "abstract": "For museums of any size, it's challenging to get a website project launched and produced on time. During these tough financial times many website redesigns or enhancement projects have been put on-hold or prolonged due to lack of resources. One way to deal with these set backs is to collaborate with other museums to implement similar web platforms to share knowledge and cut costs. The Balboa Park Online Collaborative (BPOC) launched 21 websites since the collaborative was formed fewer than three years ago. Working with a handful of developers, the collaborative has migrated many of the Balboa Park museum websites over to Drupal, the open-source CMS web platform. The web development work is part of BPOC's mission to have the Balboa Park museums work with common technology platforms so they can have access to features and tools they normally could not afford. Once a museum is using Drupal for its site, BPOC has the ability to add new modules and capabilities and expand on shared knowledge.  Expanded capabilities installed include shopping carts, collection publishing tools, and calendaring systems. In this forum, we will discuss how the collaborative model can allow the production of website features quickly working with nimble teams consisting of software developers, museum professionals, and experienced project managers. We will also discuss how this model can help tackle the sometimes daunting issues museums often face when taking on a new website project.  "

    "abstract": "The Balboa Park Online Collaborative (BPOC) is currently building the Balboa Park Commons, a site that will bring together digitized collections content from 26 museums and cultural institutions into a rich online resource at balboapark.org. Balboa Park is a 1,200-acre park in the heart of the city of San Diego and its 85 cultural and recreational organizations attract more than 10 million visitors per year.  The park museums participating in the Commons project include The San Diego Museum of Art, The San Diego Air and Space Museum, The San Diego Natural History Museum, the Museum of Photographic Arts, and the San Diego History Center, to name just a few. The key goals of the Commons project are to 1.) increase the visibility of the museums' content by providing the public with unprecedented access to rare and unique collections from the Balboa Park museums 2.) design a tool-set that meets the needs of San Diego educators and students, and 3.) attract new, more diverse audiences by including social software tools that allow visitors to create their own stories and discover interesting and fun connections across the collections. In this mini-workshop, we will highlight the technical and non-technical aspects of developing an online digital commons that engages audiences in the creative use of cultural heritage materials.  The workshop will review the process of designing a user-centered website based on community workshops and an extensive wireframe process; development of tool sets based on a PHP platform, using a digital asset management system and APIs; and the approach and issues related to creating a new model for getting large data-sets and aggregated collection content online. With each aspect of the project, we'll discuss how we're using funding and available museum resources in cost-efficient ways. This mini-workshop is designed for museum professionals interested in large-scale online collection projects, new models for collaboration and new models for collection access and engagement."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "School outings to cultural institutions are potentially wonderful opportunities for bringing youngsters closer to culture. Unfortunately, most of the times, they are not as successful as they might be. Students welcome these events as \"free time\" rather than learning occasions; they do not pay enough attention to the explanations during the visit, especially if they are not supposed to be the subject of evaluation when back to school: thus, the overall educational impact is quite poor. Families too undervalue these occasions. Teachers, on their side, are often at a loss on how to effectively prepare the class for the visit, how to \"follow-up\", how to raise their students' interest. It is now widely proved, in the field of pedagogy, that the learner's active role, as well as a clear goal, can trigger motivation and lead to the achievement of substantial educational benefits. This can explain the success of Policultura (www.policultura.it), a program aimed at school of all grades, where students create multimedia (and multichannel) \"stories\" about cultural topics. Started in 2006, Policultura has gathered so far more than 15,000 participants, aged between 4 and 18, with 700 stories approximately. 20% circa of these stories are about school outings to cultural institutions: kids (1) get set before the visit, studying the overall cultural frame. Oftentimes they are divided into groups, each in charge of a specific aspect which they are supposed to go in depth into; (2) they go to the visit, take pictures (with their cameras or cell phones), take notes, in view of the story making. Aware of their task, they pay attention, ask questions and clarifications, gather content, etc. Teachers report the surprisingly high level of engagement of these young \"multimedia authors\". When (3) they get back to school, the production phase begins: texts are written and refined, pictures are chosen, drawings are made and scanned, additional material is looked for, etc. In order to create their multimedia story, schools use 1001stories, an online authoring environment made available for free by HOC-LAB of Politecnico. The result is an exciting educational process and a beautiful multimedia \"motion picture\", where the cultural institution is the \"star\". Reports say that families too get involved in the process and sometimes, at the end of the work, they are led to the museum/park/institution etc. by their kids, who are by then so knowledgeable that they act as guides (Garzotto, Paolini, Museums and the Web 2008). All the stories are gathered in a brand new, state of the art, portal (that will be made public in December 2011). An advanced exploratory interface allows users to access the stories using different canvases, highlighting different features, selecting different facets, etc. Continuous feedback provides the user with information about how the different facets are correlated (e.g. the discipline vs. the type of learning experience, the specific subject vs. the level of schooling). Facets can also be correlated with words clouds derived from the abstracts (in English and Italian) of the stories. Other facets concern more pedagogical aspects. Users can drop their comments, though they cannot rate the stories (for pedagogical reasons). PoliCultura-portal is likely to be the largest (worldwide) collection of students-generated multimedia content. The paper will illustrate how PoliCultura has been beneficial for the cultural heritage domain, and how PoliCultura Portal can be used to promote digital storytelling at school."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "The digital turn, whether it be in photography, motion pictures, literature or other persuits, has forever changed the ways and means by which museums collect, interpret and dessiminate objects.  Historically, museums have dealt primarily with objects that, in some way, are intuitiviely graspable from observation.  Arrowheads are pointy, photographs are plainly seen, and writing read (with varying degrees of difficulty).   Digital information, on the other hand, is many times more difficult to intuitively grasp, and in many cases impossible to intuitively grasp.  This has lead to a shifting approach in collection management: collect materials before they are scattered to the hard drives and floppy discs of history.  With such a shift in approach, museums must become adept at preserving digital objects and ephemera in their original context, in many cases, a website.  We examine one site of particular interest and complexity: Flickr.   Preserving Flickr has long been a popular subject of conversation among Flickr staff, alumni, and the museum community.  Various tools and first steps have been taken, but no one to date has addressed the seemingly impossible task of preservation. The authors of this paper are very familiar with its subject.  Aaron Straup Cope is a Flickr alumni, and Ryan Donahue is the Manager of Information Systems at George Eastman House, an early partner institution of the Flickr Commons.  Through our own knowledge and consultation with museum professionals, we shall address: * The expectations of the community, that is to say, our assertions about the quality and characteristics of the information that is needed for preservation, which data is nice to have, and what is unlikely to be particularly important in the future, or even confusing. * The state of Flickr today:  What preservation mechanisms exist, the availability of programatic access to data via the Flickr API, and any ancillary issues pertaining to Flickr as it is today. * Technical specifications of preserving Flickr: storage size, medium, formats, etc. and the rough costs of archiving when leveraging advances in archival storage, such as in-line block-level de-duplication, embedded metadata and non-relational data stores. * Formulate a strategy for preservation that may be applied to other such sites of interest, integrating the foundational work of the OAIS model.   "

Some people may use their local community paper to find a listing of the next weekend's events but many others will use their smartphones, tablets, or laptops-or seek instant access to the information once they've arrived at a destination. Given museums' limited staffing, re-entering data is not an efficient use of resources. But what are the best practices for creating content for multiple platforms? At the Balboa Park Online Collaborative, we have created a flow through which calendar events are created for the Balboa Park website and are fed out to a branded Balboa Park iPhone app, Spotlight Mobile's Meridian platform (for iOS and Android devices), and on-site interactive kiosks. We have also made duplicate versions of this feed available to media outlets for their use in creating community calendars. This paper and session will review the steps through which participants could develop a similar flow for their organizations' content and discuss aspects of the content that need to be optimized for mobile apps and kiosks.  This session is appropriate for staff who manage web and mobile content for their organizations."

    "abstract": "The presentation of this paper would be given by the two lead partners in the Your Paintings project: the BBC and the PCF. It would describe: (i)    The nine-year project to create a comprehensive photographic record of all oil paintings in public ownership across the United Kingdom that will reach its conclusion at the end of 2012. By that date the project will have catalogued approximately 200,000 paintings from around 3,000 collections including not only those in museums but also works in universities, hospitals, fire stations and other public buildings. The largest of these collections is the National Trust with over 12,000 oil paintings. At the other end of the scale are many collections that hold just one painting. In between lie famous collections such as Tate and the National Gallery and a massive core of unsung local authority museums. (ii)  The project to build and then run the Your Paintings website including reference to the audience research that preceded the build, the engagement of stakeholders, the programmes to reach wider audiences, how we are connecting broadcast BBC arts programmes to the Your Paintings website and the measures of success that are being used to track project progress. (iii)The Your Paintings Tagger crowdsourcing project at http://tagger.thepcf.org.uk/ which is creating enhanced meta data for the Your Paintings website using a methodology used in the classification of galaxies by the Citizen Science Alliance (the Galaxy Zoo project). This interface was built for the PCF by its supplier Keepthinking with Art Historical input provided to the project by the University of Glasgow. This meta data will allow users of the Your Paintings website to search for specific subject matter and styles and movements in paintings. (iv)  The plans to make Your Paintings data and images available to collections (and possibly others), through an API and other data sharing web services, thereby unlocking new value. The challenges addressed will include rights issues and technical barriers. (v)    The plans to create an online network of pro bono oil paintings expertise for participating collections to refer to in partnership with leading UK collections and the University of Glasgow. This network would play a role in substantiating useful suggestions about missing painting information that are being made by the public through the Art Detective feature on the Your Paintings website.   Andrew Ellis (PCF) and Dan Gluckman (BBC)      "

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "In the past few years, most museums have witnessed a growing number of visitors to their websites.  For the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA), those online visits easily surpass the number of visitors to the museum's physical campus. Despite this success, however, very little is known about this audience: who they are, how they engage with the site, and what experiences they might take away from their visit. Information about online users is available to museums via powerful and easy-to-use web statistics tools like Google Analytics. Recent work by Finnis, Chan, and Clements (2011) describes a set of best-practices and analytical approaches for evaluating online success. However, many of these techniques tend to focus on the technical details of visits to a website, and - used in isolation - do not provide a deep understanding of more abstract information about user needs, motivations, and satisfaction. Without this information it can be difficult for museums to effectively design, promote, and evaluate on-line content and services.  User segmentation has been the basis of marketing practice for more than 50 years, but has also been one of the most popular techniques for understanding website users, attempting to provide a predictable model of visitor behavior. While more complex analyses that correlates psychographic segmentation - particularly motivation - with actual behavior, are common practice in the visitor studies field, similar methods have not been extensively applied for online audiences.  Prior work by Haley-Goldman and Schaller (2004) at the Institute for learning Innovation and by Peacock and Brownbill (2007) at the Museum Victoria Australia have discussed methods for addressing this kind of audience segmentation. Following up on the work done by these researchers, the IMA is conducting a series of online studies to identify which psychographic variables including motivation have an impact on the way visitors engage with the museum's website and the definition of segments that can be used as a reference in the evaluation and the development of content and services. In this paper, the authors will describe the reasons for undertaking such research, the method used for analysis, and the preliminary results of the study. Authors will discuss how these results might provide a reference dataset, and a replicable model for other museums that are interested in better understanding their online audience and in conducting similar studies for their own web efforts.

    "abstract": "At Museums and the Web 2011, I proposed and led an unconference session called \"Setting Ourselves Up to Fail: Low Cost, Low Stakes Strategies for Visitor Engagement.\" About 40 MW attendees participated, and we had a lively discussion and brainstorm on the topic. My current project is an attempt to test out some of the ideas from this session in real space and real time at my museum.   ArtGameLab is an interactive exhibition of crowd-sourced game prototypes, displayed and distributed in SFMOMA's Koret Visitor Education Center.  My aim in proposing this paper is to report back on this experiment, using the key principles from my unconference session as measures of the project: What does it mean to be \"low cost?\" And \"low stakes?\" How did this project succeed (and fail) in overcoming institutional barriers to experimentation? How can we use games to engage visitors, and how can we measure their engagement? Several months ago, we sent an open call out to Bay Area game designers, experience designers and conceptual artists.  We asked for inventive but low-cost ideas for games SFMOMA's visitors can play in the galleries and other public spaces of the museum.  I received about 50 proposals from community members from a multitude of disciplines and with wide-ranging levels of experience. The proposals varied from the highly-technological to the determinedly-analog, from the absolutely-feasible to the absurdly-farfetched.  I am currently collaborating with the artists and designers who submitted the strongest and simplest game ideas to develop: prototypes, proposals for thought-provoking games that cannot be executed, and engaging public programs. Starting in January 2012, the museum will display this selection of crowd-sourced games onsite, and provide a list of all SFMOMA-based game resources online at sfmoma.org/artgamelab (url not yet active).  The exhibition will include hands-on activities, opportunities for discussion, and avenues for critical thought about gaming in museums.  Programs around the exhibition will include a panel discussion on the topic, regular \"SFMOMA's Got Game\" meet-ups for community members who want to play together, and opportunities for visitors to invent their own games.  The primary goal of this exhibition is to engage SFMOMA's community in employing vocabularies of game play to test out strategies for visitor engagement.  Like a game, I am setting up the parameters but have no idea at this point what the exact substance or outcome will be.  This is wholly an experiment, and I wish to share my findings - both successes and failures - with my colleagues in the field at the upcoming Museums and the Web."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "Emergent mobile and web-based technologies offer museum professionals with new ways of engaging visitors with their collections.  Museums are powerful narrative learning environments and mobile technology can enable visitors to experience the narratives in museum objects and galleries and integrate them with their own personal narratives and interpretations. The QRator project explores how handheld mobile devices and new internet enabled interactive digital labels can create new models for public engagement, personal meaning making and the construction of narrative opportunities inside museum spaces. This project is located within the emerging technical and cultural phenomenon known as 'The Internet of Things'. The term refers to the cultural shift that is anticipated as society moves to a ubiquitous form of computing in which every device is 'on', and every device is connected in some way to the Internet.   The project is based around the project 'Tales of Things' (http://www.talesofthings.com) which has developed a 'method for cataloguing physical objects online which could make museums and galleries a more interactive experience' (Giles, 2010). QRator takes the technology a step further bringing the opportunity to move the discussion of objects direct to the museum label and onto users' mobile phone, allowing the creation of a sustainable model for two-way public interaction in museum spaces. The QRator project leverages multiple iPads as digital labels installed in the UCL Grant Museum to provide a fully interactive experience where visitors contribute to discussions and leave comments about individual exhibits.  Visitor comments are synchronised with the QRator website to allow visitors to contribute with the continuing discussion away from a museum setting.   The QRator website is fully integrated into the museum experience allowing users to contribute to the discussion from outside the museum.   The application provides each exhibit with a QR code, a matrix barcode that embeds information such as text or an URL within a graphic that users can read using mobile devices, which links the physical exhibit with associated conversations.  When scanned these codes allow users to discover more information about an object and allows them to join the conversation from their own mobile device. This research aims to actively to engage visitors in the creation of their own interpretations of museum collections. This paper presents a collaborative project between UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis and UCL Museums and Collections. It will present our initial findings from the first 6 months of installation and the next steps for adding multimedia experience to the QRator project.   We will also discuss the technical challenges associated with creating the QRator application and linking into the already established framework of the 'Tale of Things' project: highlighting the challenges faced with installation and the outcomes of user centred development activities, as well as providing an insight into how utilising mobile technology can enhance visitor meaning making and narrative construction."

    "abstract": "Digitization is providing heritage institutions with a range of possibilities for sharing curatorial and ethnographic authority with originating communities. More than creating access to collections, institutional practices of making digital collections public have opened spaces for virtual repatriation and the production of alternative representations of tangible and intangible cultural knowledge. In 2009, a delegation of Inuvialuit elders, youth, cultural workers, and media producers traveled with anthropologists to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History to view and document the MacFarlane Collection, the most significant collection of Inuvialuit material culture. In the months after the visit, the group worked with Smithsonian curators and developers of the Reciprocal Research Network (RRN) (http://www.rrnpilot.org) to make the MacFarlane Collection's digital records available for the Inuvialuit production of a virtual exhibit. The exhibit producers leveraged the RRN's API (Application Programming Interface) to remediate publicly available institutional data as a virtual repatriation of the collection. \"Inuvialuit Living History\" demonstrates ongoing connections between the MacFarlane Collection and contemporary Inuvialuit knowledge and cultural practice. In the process, new questions are raised about histories of ownership, the possibility of repatriation, and opportunities and challenges associated with the virtual repatriation of cultural heritage.  "

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "The Missouri History Museum launched a first version cross-collection search in mid-2010.  That implementation uses SOLR as a search engine with data from multiple domains (objects, archives, and photo collections) indexed to SOLR documents with various PHP scripts.  Although some attempts were made to map data values to specific locations, dates, and subjects, most of the data is indexed as text fields.  After user feedback and considering what would be possible with semantic web tools we identified a number of limitations to this approach: 1) text based facets are often ambiguous or vague; 2) users do not have the ability to further explore the context of search results; 3) data from different domains must be 'watered down' to conform to the search index; 4) data is not available as linked open data; and 5) we are missing an opportunity to contribute to the web of data through crowd sourcing. To overcome these limitations the prototype of our next version is built firmly on sematic web technologies: RDF, SPARQL, and triple/quad stores.  The prototype strives to meet the following requirements: 1) aggregate and index data from different domains and from multiple institutions; 2) expose a repository of linked open data; 3) index by specific data types (personal and corporate entities, geocoded locations, date ranges, and common vocabularies);  4) maintain the rich context of data from multiple domains and institutions; and 5) allow users to make contextual links between items, people, locations, dates, and subjects - thereby contributing to the web of data.  At the heart of this approach is a semantic data pipeline that 'ingests' mixed data, converts it to RDF, transforms data to common data formats, aligns collection-specific fields to common fields, indexes to SOLR, and provides both a faceted search interface and a SPARQL endpoint for linked open data. The prototype approach is not a single application; rather it is a proposed pipeline that uses many different tools that conform to semantic web standards such as RDF, RDFS, OWL, and SPARQL. Since they rely on web standards, tools may be swapped out for others that serve the same purpose without 're-building' the pipeline.  For example, there are many tools for converting between various data formats  - called 'RDFizers', but our prototype uses D2RQ for converting relational databases to RDF; and modmarc2RDF for converting MARC records to RDF.  There are many tools for converting between various RDF formats - our prototype uses the ARC2 library.  Many tools exist for storing and querying RDF - we use Sesame.   Finally, there are several tools available for transforming/mapping RDF data - we use DERI Pipes. I will present the motivations and logic behind the proposed pipeline; discuss the pros and cons of various pipeline tools; and discuss the challenges and pitfalls we faced when building the prototype. "

    "abstract": "Museums cannot ignore the importance of digital publishing and the impact it has on the organization's content strategy.  In this paper, Rachel Craft, Director of Publishing and Media at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis, IN and Sarah Hromack, Digital Content Manager at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY-both professional blog editors-will consider the practical and theoretical implications of developing online publishing projects through disparate approaches while making an argument for institutionally-generated publications as a valuable means of engaging wider audiences.   Using the Whitney Museum's recently launched online magazine, Whitney Stories (http://whitney.org/WhitneyStories), as her primary case study, Sarah Hromack will discuss the process of garnering in-house support for the publication, building an editorial and writing team, and pooling resources across departments in order to envision and execute a space for articulating more incidental, behind-the-scenes institutional narratives to the public. Those who face operational and budget limitations may find practical advice in this narrative, which will present publishing platforms and useful online tools for organizing and running an in-house publication.     Rachel Craft will approach the subject from the perspective of developing a digital publishing process that builds off of existing structures. The IMA is seeking to reorient its publication strategy and will be exploring how auxiliary stories and multimedia can be developed around existing catalogue content to enrich the digital reading experience. Proposed projects range from revisiting past publications to envisioning online-only editions of future scholarly catalogues.  How can an organization create publications with substantial and purposeful interactive elements while avoiding the pitfalls of creating a \"bells and whistles\" effect?    This paper will also survey content approaches being explored by other organizations, both inside and outside of museums, and how these methods can inform and inspire our own work.  In addition, a range of self-publishing tools will be presented that organizations can utilize to embark on their own digital publishing projects."

Offered as a resource for the museum community as a whole, the project was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and is hosted by The Tech Museum in San Jose, CA. The ambitions of the program include development of museum exhibits and content through open contribution by a diverse community of curators, experts, hobbyists, scientists, and thinkers. This is accomplished by connecting with individuals, institutions, and online communities internationally. Thus far the project has involved the participation of over 20 institutions and 1300 site members, who have generated more than 400 exhibit designs and video projects. As part of the grant products we will present a report of these methods for the museum industry in the form of a project white paper at Museums and the Web 2012. The paper includes descriptions of the methods in use and results obtained by the project. These are summarized in a practical structure which covers open source approaches for Casual Contribution, Mentored Development, or Expert Network level contributors. It also explains how to apply a range of open innovation categories to structure open source projects. The paper is meant as a guide for institutions considering open innovation programs or open design projects."

    "abstract": "Museums of Korea have a rapid development since 1910 because of peculiar historical background. In other words, Korean museums should have keep pace with the times as the Japanese colonial period (1910~1945), industrialization period (1970s~1980s), period of rapid expansion of IT industries (1990s~2000s). The tradition including museum was regarded as a kind of abuses and was received public indifference because of economic reasons until 1980. Museums of Korea have started to be interested in high technology since 1990~2000s as a compensation for their apathy period. However, museums in Korea have many failures because high technology is always accompanied by high cost and high risk, chasm. The Exhibition, titled \"Afterlife: The Journey to the other world\", we curated at summer(July 16~September 25) of 2011 to cope this circumstances could be distinguished three unique points from other exhibitions in Korea. First, It's the first attempt in museum of Korea to merge between Korean traditional culture and reinterpretation at present as 'Webtoon(a professional cartoonist's serial cartoon serviced by Korean portal site)'. Second, we adopt New Media like AR(Augmented Reality) and Media Art as important role of storytelling line of this exhibition. It's also the first attempt to adopt technology as storyteller of exhibition. The entire exhibition space is consist of two rooms(permanent gallery of Korean funeral bier and special gallery for temporary exhibition). We put one Media artwork between two rooms that have visual screen responding sound as role of Styx(a river in Hades) and six AR screen for museum visitor to explain six judgments in Hell. Third, because of adopting open source and worked with human resources in college, we could manage to handle this exhibition at half price while Museums of Korea usually spend over $30,000 for one special exhibition. Consequently, the total numbers of exhibition visitor are over 1600, these figures exceed the mean number of private museum in Korea. Also we received great attention in Korean press(20 times). In addition, we had a survey of two hundreds visitor's reply about this exhibition what they feel."

    "abstract": "During the demonstration the prototype of the ViMuseo tool will be presented. The ViMuseo is a tool to create virtual museums (implemented as Web CMS). It is designed for small institutions that want to increase their digital accessibility, interact with their audiences and network with other museums. Museum representatives can register, describe their own institution, add objects (object consist of textual description, images, YouTube films, Google maps, etc.) and use them to create virtual exhibitions and projects. The exhibitions and objects may be shared, stored, commented and tagged. Two development versions of the system were demonstrated at the MW2011[1]. This year the final prototype with ready solutions will be presented, and the basic functionalities demonstrated. The main focus is put on the graphic user interface design, which facilitates friendliness, usability and simple navigation. In the design process, many important elements were considered: (1) sustainable development and technological change: how to design flexible solutions which work on different devices and are supported by different technologies? (2) usability: how to meet the requirements and skills of the users, who are not very familiar with fancy museum applications, but are ordinary internet users, and (3) interrelation between traditional graphic design and digital design: what traditional design elements and rules can be successfully incorporated into a digital project. The ViMuseo system has been planned, discussed and developed in cooperation with the programmers, graphic designers and of a number of small Finnish local history museums, which are run on a voluntary basis. The development is supported by research on small museums and new technologies in the Finnish context. The ViMuseo tool is a part of an exploratory research project conducted at the Department of Art and Culture Studies at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland) and within the doctoral program of the Finnish Research Education Network on the Society's Memory Functions. The goals of the research are: (1) to investigate the possibilities of new media in presenting cultural heritage in small museums; (2) to analyze the cooperation between the researcher, graphic designers and programmers, and (3) to construct the tool to create virtual museums. Modified ethnographic action research (EAR), participatory design (PD) methodologies are used in this research. Research is aimed at digital inclusion of small, Finnish museums, and to provide results that may be used in other national development projects and initiatives, such as Museum2015 and the Local Museums' Functioning Development Project (appointed by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture). The research follows the Finnish and international recommendations and standards. Its future implementation is at this moment being discussed and planned with the other Finnish projects. The non-commercial and interdisciplinary nature of the project represents an unique approach to design, research and development of online museum services. It provides innovative design and research results, which make us reconsider many museum, design and research practices and theories.

    "abstract": "In June 2011, more than a year of intensive experimentation with Augmented Reality at The British Museum culminated in a large-scale education project with 700 teenagers. This paper presents results of quantitative and observational research on the project focusing especially on how AR impacts learning and the use of tablets in museum galleries. It explores the challenges of implementing the two main styles of mobile AR (marker-based and location-based) in gallery environments with low lighting, visitor overcrowding and without wireless networks. The aim is to share our experience of implementing AR applications for children and families within the constraints faced by nearly all museum education departments: small budgets, lack of staff resources, technical expertise and technical infrastructure. The British Museum's digital learning team launched its first mobile AR application in November 2010. Despite a tiny budget and only three weeks development time, the Passport to the Afterlife (http://bit.ly/dLSwtH) activity successfully introduced marker-based AR into museum galleries. It revealed crucial insights about the appropriate use of AR for children, the potential of mobile AR for kinesthetic learning and the importance of blending AR interaction with analog techniques to ensure a rewarding learning experience. Three more AR projects built on this initial experience. The most recent and ambitious is the Gallery Explorer (http://vimeo.com/25782400), a location-based AR game that runs across five different galleries and features 35 carefully selected museum objects. It runs on Samsung Galaxy 7\" Tablets which are shared by students age 14-15 working in groups of 5-6. This project provided the opportunity for formal evaluation (http://wiki.museummobile.info/archives/91923) of how groups work together with tablet-sized mobile devices, what specifically AR adds to students' experience of the gallery and how to design a compelling AR interface. During the past 12-18 months, most museum use of AR was for one-off events or temporary installations for adult visitors. While incredibly exciting, these applications were not designed to run in the day to day context of museum education, with its continuous and demanding stream of children, teachers and parents. This paper gets down to the nitty gritty of how AR's game-like interaction can be integrated into proven and sustainable models for gallery learning activities and become a core element of digital education programs in museums."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "In 2011, the New York Times published an article that reinforces what many museums are feeling as they scramble to keep pace with changes in technology. Entitled, \"Software Progress Beats Moore's Law\", the article cites a White House advisory report detailing the changes in hardware and software innovation in the past 15 years. The report notes that while the rate of change in hardware innovation is staggering, changes in software have vastly outpace even those impressive numbers. Perhaps most challenging for museums today are the changes occurring in the mobile industry.  This leads to questions about how best to take advantage of mobile tools to promote access, interpretive content, and engaging experiences for the public - and at the same time, find solutions that are scalable and able to be maintained over a long period of time. As described in (Stein 2011), the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) proposed a platform called TAP that envisioned a modular software framework in addition to a formal description of mobile tour content called TourML. The IMA released an initial version of the TAP and TourML framework in 2009, which has subsequently been adopted by a number of museums. While the initial TAP software proved stable and capable of serving a variety of needs in museums, it fell short of the ability to support the vision and needs of the community as expressed in several working meetings about the specification. In 2011, the Institute for Museum and Library Services awarded a National Leadership Grant to a collaboration of museums, led by the IMA, to create and extend upon the TAP & TourML open-source platform to create a suite of interchangeable tools that can support the creation of reusable mobile experiences. This paper will discuss the goals of the project, the current state of the TourML specification (including its relationship to other open-source mobile projects), and will outline the software development roadmap for the project. Authors will describe the various components of the TAP system and how modules from the toolkit can be used individually or in combination to build a variety of museum mobile experiences. Rather than being a stand-alone product, the paper will document the ways that TAP and TourML seek to integrate with existing museum authoring tools and commercial mobile systems creating a method for interchange and migration of mobile content between these systems.  This same interchange method can help museums preserve and reuse the content developed for mobile tours and can potentially lead to the ability for museums to share and trade content elements between distinct mobile experiences.

Visitors want to search across data, on multiple dimensions, and find other artworks that may interest them. To do this with the data available was a huge challenge.   Museum collections data is not necessarily structured to support this, especially in a collection as diverse as the Met's.  In this paper we discuss the system we built to enable the Museum to analyse the data and construct rules to support these user journeys.  With this system, Museum staff match terms against standard vocabularies (including AAT and TGN), provide contextual interpretation of terms by department, qualify terms such as locations, and define rules for common misspellings.  A powerful Solr search system provides the quick and complex search functionality, establishes the relationships between artworks, provides free-text searching, and gives facet counts."

This project aims to create new platforms for digital publications that provide in-depth curatorial research and conservation science alongside richly illustrated content in a format that readers find engaging, manageable, and unobtrusive. The very definition of an online scholarly publication suggests accessibility and functionalities beyond print-a complex and groundbreaking endeavor entailing many challenges and opportunities.  In envisioning our version of the online scholarly catalogue, the Art Institute of Chicago's goal was to create a publication that would embrace the exciting world of digital publishing without leaving behind the weight and authority naturally ascribed to the book format. We will demonstrate the Art Institute of Chicago's first online scholarly catalogue entries, from the series Paintings and Drawings by the Impressionist Circle in the Collection of the Art Institute of Chicago launched in November 2011, including their rich high-resolution imagery, the 'Multilayer Interactive Image Viewer' as well as citation and marginalia reader tools. For those interested in the publication's more technical end, we can also demonstrate the easy-to-use catalogue-authoring environment built in Drupal 7."

    "abstract": "As galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMS) are redefining their role as nodes in a wider network of content creators and providers, open innovation becomes key. GLAMS across the world are beginning to explore the added value of sharing data resources following the so-called linked open data (LOD) principles. In this presentation, we provide an overview of the practical uses and implications of using Linked Open Data through four projects currently running in the heritage domain. With the explosive growth of the LOD cloud of datasets, which has doubled in size every 10 months since 2007[1], more and more meaningful applications can be explored. This ranges from basic access to distributed information sources to more advanced scenarios supporting scholars in asking new research questions or posing old questions in new ways. GLAMS have much to offer: - incredibly rich and structured data sets accumulated over many years by subject experts - ability to reach out to audiences to both enrich datasets and to evaluation services - long-standing expertise in meta-data management and (co-)curation - authoritative knowledge on a wide range of subjects Parallel to activities in the area of open government data, an increasing number of so-called 'hackathons', 'culture hack days' and 'LOD-LAM[2] events' are organized, aimed at promoting the uptake of the Linked Data Principles[3]. Unfortunately, these events mainly attract developers rather than policy makers or curators working at institutions. In this contribution, we describe four projects in which GLAMs collaborate closely with outside developers to show the wide potential of LOD. 1. In Agora[4], the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam and the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision collaborate with the Computer Science and History departments at the VU to integrate their collections and enrich them with historical information to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the historical dimension of objects in online heritage collections. 2. Europeana is a pan-European initiative that provides access to millions of objects as Linked Open Data. The Europeana Thought Lab[5] search interface shows how LOD principles can aid the search process. Europeana has been a strong supporter for the uptake of CC0;  the \"no rights reserved\" in Creative Commons-licenses. 3. The Amsterdam Museum was the first museum in the Netherlands to convert its complete museum collection database to RDF. The resulting resource consists of more than 5 Million RDF triples describing over than 70.000 cultural heritage objects related to the city of Amsterdam[6]. We discuss several working examples that use this dataset, such as a mobile city guide. 4. Open Images[7] provides access to a large and growing collection of Creative Commons licensed archive material. The meta-data is converted to RDF, allowing the creation of rich semantic links between other datasets such as the the Amsterdam Museum dataset. In discussing the lessons-learned within the above projects,  we will be offer practical guidelines to start working with LOD, including key topics such as publishing and aligning datasets, developing new services and managing copyrights. --- Notes [1] http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/01/the-concept-of-linked-data.php [2] http://lod-lam.net/summit/2011/06/06/proposed-a-4-star-classification-scheme-for-linked-open-cultural-metadata/ [3] http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/lod-badges/ [4] http://agora.cs.vu.nl/ [5] http://www.europeana.eu/portal/thought-lab.html [6] http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/am [7] http://www.openimages.eu."

    "abstract": "THIS SESSION HAS BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE AUTHORS' CONTROL, BUT YOU CAN STILL READ THE PAPER. Bound for South Australia 1836 (www.boundforsouthaustralia.net.au) is a digital reenactment of the sea voyages made 175 years ago to establish the British Province of South Australia. Using captains' logs, passenger diaries, letters and other original source material, the Bound for South Australia blog retraces -through weekly real time updates- the journeys made by nine vessels from England to Australia between February and December 1836.  Over ten months in 2011, website visitors, email subscribers and social media followers were able to re-live and engage with the unfolding story of the first 500 settlers as they made their way to an unknown land across the globe.  The blog platform and associated social web technologies enabled active user participation and promoted the development of diverse communities of interest which in turn inspired an associated exhibition, schools program and public events.  In 2012, a supporting video conference-based program will enable schools to participate remotely as part of their use of this resource. The project has been very successful in bringing new life and new people to traditionally inaccessible historical material. Much of this material has not been published before or made accessible online.  One of the goals of the project has been to demonstrate how social web technologies can bring new life and opportunities for engagement with traditional historical source materials.  The multiple perspectives of the various passengers (recast here as posthumous bloggers) create a multi-faceted narrative of life on board and of the hopes and motivations of these first settlers, as they endure the travails of a months-long sea voyage, visit exotic ports of call and finally make landfall.  Once ashore, these accounts provide unique insights into early encounters with Indigenous inhabitants and the challenges of establishing a European-style settlement in unfamiliar lands. The serialised delivery of these stories in a blogging format enables a narrative approach that is more contingent, open ended - and dramatic- than traditional discursive presentations of historical events. Bound for South Australia is also explicitly addressed to both schools-based and general users, with parallel blog posts each week. The website has been selected as the first online resource in the area of history for the new national Australian curriculum. The granular structuring of content, the use of rich media and embedded curriculum links support many forms of flexible re-use within different digital learning environments. The website is a highly customised implementation of the Wordpress blogging platform integrating a unique set of widgets to support complex semantic linking of source material to create an enduring resource for scholars and school students alike. This presentation explores how this project demonstrates the possibilities of history to actively engage and connect communities using contemporary web technologies. It considers blogging as a narrative form and how the retelling of historical events can create and sustain communities of interest and identity.  It also examines the dynamics of online communities around historical source material. The project and the presentation point to future models of digital historical narrative and interpretive practice that are open, social and interactive."

    "abstract": "New Zealand's Puke Ariki Museum, Library and Visitor Center in New Plymouth recently used two different formats for collecting and displaying visitor comments in recent (2010-2011) exhibits. Both formats challenge online visitors to weigh multiple perspectives on history and the future of New Zealand. Read together, these comment areas offer insight into visitor interaction with exhibition material. In addition, the comment areas-one unconventionally designed but not interactive between users, one conventional and interactive between users-point toward new possibilities for designing and hosting audience-generated material that builds on and interrogates museum exhibits. The first, \"Te Ahi K? Roa, Te Ahi K?toro: Taranaki War 1860-2010,\" which described the war between the indigenous M?ori and European settlers, retains an online presence through a non-interactive online comment area created from a broad variety of visitor reactions to the exhibit. The comments are displayed with attractive graphics that refuse to privilege one point of view over others; the comments page gives voice to the current state of the cultural conflict over colonial and indigenous versions of history examined in the exhibit while it creates a new narrative, one that tells a multi-voiced story of New Zealanders' interaction with the past and the museum itself. The online comment presentation reveals visitors' desire to join, contest, and parallel the trajectories of the narrative presented by the exhibit and current New Zealand historical scholarship. The second, \"What If? The Future of Taranaki,\" presented on-site exhibitions and events designed to stimulate conversations on regional identity and environmental sustainability as well as an online forum space to facilitate those conversations. Subject headings included \"Sea Levels,\" \"Energy,\" \"Economy,\" and \"Communities,\" and separate threads within them asked questions such as \"What kind of Taranki do you want to see in the future?\", \"How are the changing patterns of agriculture affecting our region?\", and \"What do you think or feel about Taranaki continuing to lose its native plants and wildlife?\" The forum, which is now closed but archived, was built using traditional message board software; comments were moderated by an outside organization. In a paper presented at the International Digital Media and Arts Association Conference in Vancouver, 4 November, 2010 (and currently under review at the New Zealand Journal of Media Studies), I argued that a close rhetorical analysis of the curated comments reveals an audience-generated chronological narrative of engagement and identity with the exhibit. I plan to analyze the second exhibit's interactive forum in much the same way; I also will suggest that the graphic design of the first comment area offers a much more appropriate foundation for an interactive discussion of cultural matters than the traditional linear message board forum used as part of the second exhibit. While the second exhibit's forum allowed visitor interaction with other visitors, it isolated comments within particular threads. Inspired by the nonlinear \"stage\" design of the first comment area, I envision a hyperlinked, easily tagged and nonlinear experience that combines interactivity with a more aesthetically and culturally satisfying user experience."

    "abstract": "The Museum of Inuit Art has been experimenting over the past year with strategies to better connect our varied audiences with the museum's collections. Many of our visitors are not local members of the community and so pursuing initiatives to share content with them on the web has been a primary goal. In late 2011, MIA is launching two new ways to bridge online content with the physical museum: installing a QR Code interactive tour in the museum's physical space and also launching an interactive virtual tour of the museum on the web. With the first project, QR Codes will be placed around the museum on specific sculptures and artwork. Using a smartphone, guests can take a picture of a QR Code and be directed to a mobile Wordpress page with additional information, embedded Youtube videos, audio clips and even Google Maps coordinates showing the origin of the piece. The second project will create a Flash-based virtual tour of the museum, so that users online as well as sponsors of the museum can take a \"Google StreetView\"-like tour through the museum, partially inspired by the Google Art Project. This paper will compare responses to the two projects and comment on lessons learned for small museum entering these arenas."

Advances in communication and multimedia technologies offer new possibilities for developing exhibits that are not only more engaging to audiences but that are also updateable and that layer information. This is especially exciting for topics where information is contested. Controversies and uncertainties are an essential and fascinating part of the scientific process, and developing means to incorporate them into exhibits is a great advance over the present state of affairs, where too often new discoveries and ongoing research are ignored. The exhibit Emergence: A New View of Life's Origin at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science is a case study that prototypes ten (or so) strategies for engaging visitors--onsite and online--in one such cutting-edge topic that is relevant to every person on the planet: How did life on Earth begin? The museum is using the exhibit to help plan a renovation of their permanent Hall of Origins, which has not been updated since the museum opened in 1987. Of particular interest is how technology and social media can be used to connect a physical museum exhibit to audiences beyond museum walls.    The Emergence exhibit and exhibit website (nmnaturalhistory.org/emergence) incorporate (or will soon incorporate) a complexity science iPad app and e-book, three interactive components (a new geologic timeline, a new tree of life, and making a cell), 3D and 2D video, and more. The project was initiated by the Santa Fe Institute, an international research center for complexity science, and funded through a National Science Foundation grant to them. The exhibit was a project of PICT: the Program in Interactive Cultural Technology at New Mexico Highlands University. This biannual full-semester immersive experience engaged twelve students in all aspects of exhibit development from start to finish. The project team also included scientists from the Santa Fe Institute, faculty and staff from the university and the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs, two interns from our AmeriCorps Cultural Technology Program, museum staff and other professionals, and many others who volunteered time and expertise."

    "abstract": "After 10 years of sustained digitization, the National Maritime Museum developed a new website and lounge to showcase its vast collection. The purpose of both projects was to open up the museum's collection and archive and induct museum browsers into a research experience. The digital interactives within the Compass Lounge allow the Museum to display more objects. For example, the Horizon displays over 4,000 images from five collections - ship models, oil paintings, flags, uniforms and coins/medals - grouped only by visual similarity. This view transcends Museum classifications, allowing thousands of objects to be seen without imposed interpretation. The plan chest is a physical embodiment of the Museum's collections website. Wooden drawers are pulled out to reveal large digital touchscreens, each showing the most popular objects - how many times objects have been viewed, shared, added to a personal collection or tagged. In doing so, the plan chest showcases the collection in use. A linked LED installation shows the relevant accession number, highlighting this unique key to all information and media about an object. A supporting mobile website offers a simple accession number search. A small selection of historic photographs is also displayed in the lounge, each label inviting the public to contribute their own knowledge to the Museum's records, The display will be refreshed twice a year through a process of co-curation with the public. Every visitor to the Museum is given their own Compass Card to reveal the hidden connections between people and the objects in the collection, in the form of beautifully-packaged stories. Visitors are sent a free, personalised ebook reflecting the objects they collected. They're also invited to make an apointment to view the 'real thing' in the new archive reading room. There is a constant interplay between the physical and the digital and a deliberate playfulness in the transitions between the two states. But our museum holds many more items than even the Compass system and lounge can expose. This paper will explore how museums could reveal more of their collections by producing dense displays of objects with limited fixed interpretation but hooks into deep digital services, especially as computer vision brings the possibility to refine this interaction and make it more magical. The object itself will be a 'service avatar': all of the evocative power of an object, used to access services in the cloud (where the cloud is all human culture and history)."

    "abstract": "This paper will discuss the importance and impact of developing, delivering and sustaining a digital strategy within a cultural organisation. It will use recent experiences at The National Gallery, UK and the Imperial War Museum (IWM), UK to demonstrate why having a strategy is so fundamental to the long-term success of digital development in organisations, and how it can be used as a driver to shape direction for a strategic programme of work that is aligned with organisational needs and priorities. Both the National Gallery and the IWM are going through periods of organisational change, including reassessing the role and importance of digital in delivering the organisations' goals. Despite being very different organisations in regard to structure, size and type of collections, there are surprisingly many similarities in aspirations and approach to digital engagement. This paper will provide readers with the fundamental principles of developing a strategy, how to deploy it and embed it for long-term sustainability. It will illustrate these principles by incorporating examples from both institutions throughout. The paper will focus on the following questions: Why is a digital strategy needed? exploring the internal and external drivers importance of putting digital at the centre of the organisations' thinking How to move from theory to practice to deliver digital programmes? setting priorities for a programme of work measures of success How to keep the strategy alive and evolving? embedding digital across the organisation evaluating progress/success revisiting and refining the strategy The principles detailed in this paper and the illustrative practical examples from the National Gallery and Imperial War Museum will be of benefit to any organisation, large or small. It will demonstrate that a digital strategy is more than just a written document. A digital strategy provides a vision and action plan that is a framework and focus for all digital activity across an organisation. By placing digital at the heart of the institution, it can be a genuine driver for change. Target Audience: Senior staff, managers, consultants - those interested in strategic planning and project delivery."

    "abstract": "At the start of 2011, Australia's Museum Victoria (MV), published a Field Guide for Victorian Animals for iOS devices: iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. The app currently contains information for approximately 650 Victorian animal species, including birds, mammals, snakes, lizards and frogs, as well as butterflies, snails, spiders and other invertebrates. Released for free, the app was downloaded over 20,000 times in its first 7 months. In August 2011, Museum Victoria (MV) released the source code for the app under an open source license. Organisations and individuals have used the code to produce field guides for something specific as the frogs within a river catchment area, to the fauna of Papua New Guinea. The field guide data structure and code is built for displaying information about fauna, however the presentation structure of the app is suitable for displaying information about a wide range of fields. This lead to the development of the Genera project for iOS, which, rather than requiring the data about an object to be supplied in a specific structure to fit the database, adjusts the the database based on the structure of the data supplied. This project can be used to create guides for flora, fauna, minerals or any type of object. The subject of the guide does not have to be a homogenous class of objects, but through the use of templates and identifiers can accommodate heterogenous classes (e.g. fauna and flora). This paper discusses how the work done by other organisations and the experience of developing the field guide has lead to the development of the Genera project for iOS. Key to the project is the separation of the data, platform and presentation layers. A description of how other organisations can use the Genera platform for their own apps, and suggestions on issues to consider when developing natives app for reuse by other institutions are presented."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "EUscreen represents all major European television archives and acts as a key aggregator providing audiovisual content to Europeana. The project aims at the creation of an online collection of representative television programmes, secondary sources of information and articles, facilitating access to students, scholars and the general public. The multidisciplinary dimension of the project is mirrored in the composition of the socio-technical nature of the consortium composed of 20 audiovisual collection owners, technology providers, legal experts, educational technologists and media historians from 20 European countries. The main technical goals of EUscreen are to (i) implement and operate a state-of-the-art workflow for content ingestion, (ii) provide a front-end that accommodates requirements of several user groups. Metadata aggregation is implemented through the MINT platform (http://euscreen.image.ntua.gr/euscreen). MINT facilitates the ingestion, semantic alignment and aggregation of metadata records. It also implements a variety of remediation approaches. Interoperability is achieved on the basis of a well established harvesting schema, for which EUScreen uses the EBUCore metadata set as a conceptual reference model (http://tech.ebu.ch/lang/en/MetadataEbuCore). EBUCore interoperability is strongly maintained with respect to W3C developments through EBU's active participation in the development of the Media Annotation ontology. The EUscreen project (http://euscreen.eu) has recently taken steps to expand its scope to provide unified access to large integrated digital collections related to European television history. By supporting the Linking Open Data W3C community project and by signing the new Europeana Data Exchange Agreement, the material  is made accessible through the EUscreen platform and becomes more widely searchable, findable, linkable, and accessible. It is therefore more connected to the world wide web, its users and the machines that link them together. With the aggregation model in place, EUScreen was all set for an easier implementation of the Linked Data principles, which permit the interpretation and interlinking of  EUScreen data with various sources of information also outside of the EUscreen domain. EBUCore provides mappings to all known audiovisual metadata standards and the respective ontology was used to formalise  and serialise metadata in the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is now published by EUScreen as Linked Open Data. More specifically, the first step was to map the harvesting EUscreen schema to the EBUcore ontology. The second step was to perform internal and external linking of the data set, initially using , specific elements of the harvesting schema relating items. Values of elements like location and language were linked, and used to discover potentially interesting relevant external resources. The first outcome of this process was the linking of EUScreen's video content and metadata to the DBpedia, Eurostat, Freebase and NY Times data sources (http://lod.euscreen.eu/). The paper discusses the reasoning behind the workflow, the set-up and overview of the process and how these technical developments effectively improve access to our shared television history to students, teachers and the general audience. The ongoing operation on Linked Data publication and consumption within the project and especially the participation of television archives in its validation is also being discussed as an important and new aggregation task."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "Archives can be esoteric places that are difficult to access. Augmented Reality applications tend to focus on visual experience. How can pervasive mobile technology be used to make oral history archives accessible to a wider audience in creative and playful ways? For a community archive with almost no budget? Memory Bay is a Heritage Lottery Funded oral history project, begun in 2008. A partnership between St Ives Archive, Tate St Ives, the Leach Pottery and Porthmeor Studios, it consists of over a hundred recordings of voices of the community talking about their memories of the artists, writers, craftspeople, makers and designers associated with St Ives. Walking around a town is often the best way to get an idea of what a place is like, its history, identity, its many senses of place. This paper looks at how re-performing the archive using pervasive media can be used both as a way of making the archive more accessible to the wider public, and as  a tool for research.  We wanted to play with the idea of searching the archive. By relocating memories in place around the town  and extending the archive outside its walls, this would create an embodied mobile experience of the serendipitous archival encounter with memory, a rhizomatic memory treasure hunt with fragments of voices from the archive. Just as the space of the archive is both intimate and public, the experience of being in a public space can be intimate; sound, and wearing headphones, can intensify the experience of place, making you more aware of your surroundings, more present in the moment. Where other modes of augmented experience can often necessarily remove one from the immediate experience, whether reading a guidebook, or looking at a screen, sound has a more immediate, phenomenological effect. Many iterations and variations of the memoryscape were created and tested between July and November 2011, initially using HP iPAQ handheld computers and HP Labs m-scape software. Following much experimentation and user feedback, a full version was realised for iPhone in December 2011 using Bristol-based Calvium's appfurnace. Using site-specific field recordings of St Ives, composer Philip Reeder created layered ambient soundscapes which the user hears as a background to their walk. The participants put on headphones, start the application, and start to wander the streets of St Ives. Each time a user then encountered a GPS region, they would hear an extract from an oral history recording specific to that place. Poetic rather than didactic, there are multiple rhizomatic possibilities of encounter with different voices, as opposed to a walk that is linear, singular, one-way, directed. Each user creates their own narrative of place by moving through space. This phenomenological experience of place and memory is both out of time in place, and in time and out of place. It is an intertextual encounter with memory that invites links and associations between the textual of the oral history archive and the materiality of place through embodied experience.   "

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the Virtual Shtetl Portal of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews (www.sztetl.org.pl). Virtual Shtetl utilizes a Web platform that enables registered users to participate in the sharing of memories, public history and other information relevant to the preservation of Jewish cultural heritage. It aims to transform the passive role of the museum visitor to that of an active stakeholder in the preservation of cultural heritage, in this case Jewish heritage closely linked to the Polish landscape. The research upon which this study is based began during my fellowship at the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw, Poland in 2008. My observations as a participant in the Virtual Shtetl Portal during its development are complemented by fieldwork which took place in 2009, 2010 and 2011. This research took the shape of formal interviews, surveys of the site's administrators, a breakdown of Google analytics of the site's first two years of running on the Web and textual analysis. A central framework for this research is the study of the museum as a memoryscape or portal through which societies remember the past and make sense of the present. To contextualize the virtual museum, I begin with the virtuality of all museums as implied by Andre Malraux's concept of Museum without Walls and then proceed to consider why a project which inspires a cultural negotiation of memories on the Web can pluralize the experience of preserving the past in a unique way that is inclusive of a multitude of diverse perspectives and in this way, an extraordinary opportunity for international dialogue.  "

    "abstract": "How much storage will your museum need in the next 5 years? What is the best way to leverage electronic media and social networks to engage new museum audiences? When should we invest in a new online collection or a new website?  These questions and many more plague museum technology professionals who are struggling to justify the investments in technology and staff that leverage these tools for the best purposes of the museum. At the same time many report that museum directors are often unreceptive to embracing new technology projects, and are slow to adapt to changing practices in contemporary online culture. While the status quo may be changing, communications are further complicated by the fact that most museum technologists are not represented among the senior management in their museums. The creation of Digital Strategy documents for museums seems to be a common approach to addressing these concerns, attempting to insert thoughtful planning and strategic thinking about technology into the conversation at a senior management level. While it's hard to argue with the logic of developing a step-by-step plan for technology investment, is it possible that by ghettoizing technology-strategy to a realm apart from the larger strategy of the museum, we will only succeed in highlighting the perceived gaps that exist between technology issues and those of real importance and permanence for the future of museums? This paper will discuss a variety of issues that need to be considered by technology leaders when thinking about how to merge the benefits achieved through technology with the core strategic planning of the museum.  Practical suggestions about how to communicate to senior leadership about technology projects will be discussed, and specific examples regarding how to establish metrics and goals that can be indexed to the strategic plan of the museum will be given. Techniques for avoiding the \"shiny-object-syndrome\" of new technology projects will be important to demonstrate how technology tools can be fundamental in achieving the museum's primary purposes of stewarding collections, engaging audiences, and promoting the mission of the museum at a global level."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "Museum professionals spend a significant amount of time studying the ways that visitors engage with objects in their collections to improve the quality of interaction with them. Focus groups at the Indianapolis Museum of Art and elsewhere indicate that visitors see art museums as places for \"inspiration\" and \"contemplation;\" however,  visitors are observed to spend very little time actually looking at art. Obtaining a more concrete understanding of what aspects of a visit are found to be inspiring, and how museums can actively promote and encourage those experiences remain some of the field's biggest challenges. In thinking creatively as to how to address these problems, the authors began to explore whether recent advances in eye tracking technology might hold some answers. Techniques for measuring gaze have been an important part of cognitive psychology since the early 1960's. Environmental scans by Rayner (1998) summarize the scope and evolution of research linking eye tracking and cognition. Agreement in the research suggests that gaze and attention are tightly coupled (Hoffman 98) implying a direct relationship between the way we look at museum objects and our thinking about them. Research by Wooding (2002) examines the use of eye tracking systems and art from the collection of the National Gallery in London. While the data seems promising, Wooding's work focused more on a generalized method for visualizing eye tracking data and not on specific applications of these techniques for art history or museology.  Milekic (2010) published an overview of gaze tracking and its potential applications for museums, highlighting the coming advent of cheap and commercially available equipment to support the use of these tools in a museum setting. Funded by an IMLS Sparks! Ignition grant, the Indianapolis Museum of Art is exploring whether or not eye tracking technology can be useful to museums seeking to better understand how in-gallery visitors actually \"see\" the objects in our collection.  Through a set of three experiments, the project seeks to understand whether eye tracking can be used to measure visitor attention to artworks, understand the correlation between guided interpretation and visitor comprehension, and to trigger interpretive content delivery. In this paper, authors will review the relevant literature in the field that connects gaze detection and cognition; explain in detail the experimental methodology used to determine the practicality of adopting these techniques in museums; and report in initial conditions and factors discovered during the project's initial research.   Rayner, K.

    "abstract": "     This paper discusses an innovative, international, collaborative approach that we used to present and interpret archeological data found along the length of the BTC and SCP oil and gas pipelines (the \"pipelines corridor\") from the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan through the Republic of Georgia to the port of Ceyhan, Turkey, on the Mediterranean Sea. The Smithsonian's \"AGT Project\" (Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey Cultural Heritage Project) is a new international collaboration encompassing a multilingual website hosting reports of archeological investigations (in original languages and English translations), a database of archeological finds in each country, and a peer-reviewed online publication offering new interpretations of the cultural history of this pivotally important region at the juncture of Europe and Asia. The overall project encompasses archeology, ethnography, and museum capacity development. Researchers at the Smithsonian's Asian Cultural History Program, and from other Smithsonian offices, work closely with counterpart institutions in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey - including the Gobustan National Historic and Artistic Preserve, the Azerbaijan Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography and the Georgian National Museum, to highlight the richly layered material heritage of central Eurasia. We balance updated best-practice web standards with practical considerations of technical web-viewing capabilities and local user expectations in the region. Thanks to support from BP (Caspian), the project has produced, in addition to the AGT website (www.agt.si.edu) two bilingual editions of a printed book on archeological finds along the transect of the oil and gas pipelines, hosted a scholarly conference in Baku, and conducted numerous web-enhanced museum capacity building seminars and museum professional training programs. This research and capacity-building program represents a potential model for future cultural preservation projects associated with mega-infrastructure developments (pipelines, road-building, dam construction, etc.), especially those crossing international boundaries in countries whose national traditions of archeology and history provide contested or very differing interpretations of the materials uncovered.               Our web presentation of interpretive narratives, supplemented by translations of the original site reports and a new database of objects found, contrasts markedly with other presentations in this field. We include and cross-reference all sites throughout the pipelines corridor, in contrast to presentations about individual sites. The website and the accompanying multi-lingual books attempt to present and reconcile (where possible) the diverse and contesting national historical narratives (located for example on websites in each country of the region). We attempt to balance a user-friendly presentation of narratives with an extensive database for scholars, rather than present just a narrative or just a database. The paper concludes by discussing some challenges faced by efforts to impartially present a broad regional history on the Web, as these challenges are expressed in design elements, images, and structural organization as well as the choice of content presented. Digital publications provide unique means to present and compare contrasting historical narratives or interpretations of the data."

    "abstract": "In June 2011, the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) launched an integrated iPhone app - the world's first museum app to combine augmented reality (AR), location-based gaming, and interactive features - in its special exhibition, Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor and His Legacy. Specially designed to complement the flows and content of the exhibition, the main storyline uses seven interactive chapters, each highlighting at least one object on display, to engage visitors on a more personal level. As they progress through the exhibition, visitors respond to image markers that launch augmented reality and gaming experiences that breathe life into the objects. The Terracotta Warriors app became one of the top 5 downloaded iPad apps for June 2011. Visitors generally responded enthusiastically, and the app garnered much positive publicity from both local and international media. Our overall experience was positive, but there were problems and challenges along the way that inspired us to reflect. When museums turn to interactive technologies in pursuit of new ways of engaging new audiences, where do we draw the line to avoid turning the museum into a theme park? How can we most effectively get everyone up to speed with the latest technology? As the museum works to engage younger visitors with appealing technologies, do we risk distracting them from meaningful engagement with real objects? We conceived of this app as a pilot exercise that would give us an opportunity to study the adoption of technology by our visitors. The integration of several interactive features in the app also allowed us look at behaviour and interactions of users. This paper surveys the effectiveness of this implementation, explores the wider issues raised by the findings, and relates lessons learned from unforeseen challenges along the way."

Only a small part of the information can be related to words in labels. Querying individually dozens of different kinds of properties as in ISO21127 (CIDOC CRM), many of which are optional, leaves a huge recall gap compared to text retrieval. On the other hand a global restriction to \"core metadata\", to a flat set of very few properties as in Dublin Core or VRA, deprives the systems of the reasoning capability about the integrated knowledge in the semantic network.  We propose and have been implementing a new query paradigm: A very small set of \"fundamental\" categories and relationships, as we are used to from core metadata, are presented to the user in the form of a system of invisible to them complex deductions from a rich underlying network of more specialized actual metadata, rather than being primary documentation elements. Using as schema ISO21127 and specializations (extensions) of it, we are practically  able to achieve high recall rates (even 100%) with a compact set of very simple, comprehensive questions in an application comprising general cultural heritage data about museum and archaeological objects and digital provenance data of 3D digitization of the latter. But except from efficiency we also provide simplicity, as the user does not need to be experienced in any way with the concepts of the CIDOC CRM in order to obtain the desired results. Application of the presented framework can easily be adjusted to many other domain ontologies and user preferences."

    "abstract": "Measuring online performance has been one of the hot topics for museum online professionals in the UK. Tate was one of the participants in the Culture 24's action research project which focused on measuring online success. All participants agreed that reporting purely on number of visits and time spent on site fulfilled the governmental requirements, but has not necessarily helped to evaluate online presence against institutional objectives. We realised we had to start using the large amount of available metrics in a more intelligent way. In this paper we would like to present the steps we have taken to increase the benefits that online metrics can bring to other institutions and and have brought to Tate and the challenges we met on the way of spreading the analytics culture across the organisation. Using online analytics maturity models we will assess Tate's management of online analytics looking at each of the following aspects:   Management Objectives Scope Resources Methodology and process Technology There were many different reasons that motivated us to embark on this journey: most importantly, our wish to understand who our online visitors are and how they engage with Tate's content to offer the best possible user experience. The explosion in digital social engagement also changed the way we perceive, develop and evaluate content for our digital and physical spaces and the metrics have had to follow in the same fashion. The paper will uncover our analysis process and present outcomes of our metrics audit, the process of creating online analytics reports for the website launch against a new set of key performance indicators, and show how we started making sense of online metrics in a more mature way. We are also hoping to present findings from a comparative evaluation study of two campaigns to illustrate real analytics in action. The paper would have a great value as a practical case study for any organisation wanting to implement the online analytics culture across their organisations and tell stories using numbers.  "

    "abstract": "The challenges of delivering a meaningful 'mobile' experience for an institution are not always technology-related. Securing cross-departmental stakeholder investment and ensuring alignment with the institution's core mission have been key for National Museums Scotland and National Museum Wales in developing a framework for their mobile programme. This paper will explain how these organisations sought to overcome organisational challenges from the outset; pushing forward ideas and taking a common approach to planning mobile projects that can be adopted by other institutions. National Museums Scotland and National Museum Wales have many similarities in their structure and set-up. Both operate a main base out of their respective capital cities (Edinburgh and Cardiff) and have a mix of specialist rural and urban-based museums. Since 2009 the proportion of online visitors from mobile devices has increased significantly for both organisations; taking this on board alongside in-gallery research and predicted market trends, both have begun developing a programme of mobile interpretation using the same user-focused approach. For the National Museum Wales this is about making information accessible, as well as creating a link between historic buildings and collections in a rural setting at the National History Museum at St Fagans. For National Museums Scotland it's about bringing new interpretation and innovation to the recently-reopened National Museum of Scotland. Importantly, neither approach has focused on technology in the first instance - workshop sessions have concentrated on getting the right people to take a balanced view of audience needs and create design briefs that tie closely to each organisation's strategic objectives. Both projects have their specific challenges and the session will explore what led them to take certain decisions, what the outcomes have been to date, the broader implications for developing mobile products in terms of cost and impact on the museum technical infrastructure, and the lessons they feel will benefit other museums looking to develop their own plans."

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "In October 2010, Kew Gardens commissioned an in-depth study of visitors' motivations and information needs around its 300 acre site, with the express aim that it should guide the development of new mobile apps. The work involved over 1500 visitor tracking observations, 350 mini interviews, 200 detailed exit interviews and 85 fulfilment maps and gave Kew an incredibly useful insight into its visitors' wants, needs and resulting behaviours. It turns out that most Kew visitors have social, emotional and spiritual, rather than intellectual, motivations during their time here. They do not come hoping to find out more and they don't want or need to know precisely where they are all the time. In fact, they love the sense of unguided exploration and the serendipitous discoveries they make at Kew - they want to become 'delightfully lost'. This paper will explore how this perhaps counter-intuitive idea - to help visitors become 'delightfully lost' - has influenced mobile thinking at Kew. What impact has it had on mobile concept development, design, and marketing? It will then ask whether this principle might reasonably apply in other outdoor visitor attractions, museums and galleries - using existing case studies to draw out parallels and differences. Finally this paper will look at the results of Kew's summative evaluation of its garden app - does quantitative and qualitative data suggest we achieved our aims? And what does this mean for future mobile developments across the Gardens?"

    "abstract": "In recent years, more and more educational applications in mobility have appeared in museums. More often, these projects are synonymous with new forms of access towards the public, reflected by a more active investment from the visitors and a more interactive relationship between the museum and its audience. The purpose may reside in a further and innovative learning of the museum and its collection. However, what are the real contributions of these types of applications compared to more traditional offers of museum education/museum interpretation (kiosks, audio guides, guided tours…)? Do those new mobility devices favour an alternative discovery of the museum collections? If so, how to perfect in a better way this new form of learning? The existing studies show that these new devices are sources of new interactions with visitors: transverse courses, personalization according to the age, language or abilities, collaboration or pre- and post-visit activities. They also facilitate educational games creations, convenient to not conventional relationship with the artefacts and involving physically, intellectually and emotionally the visitors. However, few studies allow to judge the influence of those applications on learning. The project \"PLUG: Ubiquitous Play and Play More\" consisted in the creation of an ubiquitous game in the Musée des arts et metiers, the French national Industrial Arts and Crafts museum located in Paris. This project brought together different and complementary skills: research laboratories (computer science, information and communication science), industrial companies (Orange lab or game-design company), the museum and a non-profit organization specialized in story-telling for social events. All these combined skills aimed to explore some forms of learning like collaboration into a team and between teams and, last but not the least, to test new ones: immersion thanks to the pervasive aspect of the game, storytelling, role playing and dynamic adaptability depending on players skills and previous knowledge. This work of game's definition, development, implementation and testing is what we present here. We describe the first game we have designed, and how we developed a second one, based on the museum visitors' feedback, in order to reinforced the learning process and tend to the nearest educational objectives targeted. These two versions of the game, one representative of the theory of magic circle, the second of the flow theory, seem to have a different cognitive and affective impact on the visitors."

    "abstract": "  Where is the museum for the digital generation?  Our presentation will suggest a way of visualizing the practices that make up the identity of the distributed museum.  This presentation reports on research that examined the ways in which public museums and libraries in the United States offer informal-learning opportunities to the born-digital generation, often as part of a creative network ecology that includes formal learning programs and institutions.  Rather than present a list of \"best practices,\" this presentation will outline an analytical framework that examines a range of new practices that transcend a number of binaries used to define contemporary digital culture: i.e., the virtual versus the physical, fixed versus mobile, open versus closed systems of creative offerings.   We use the term \"the distributed museum\" to describe the form that the museum takes as it is part of the creation and movement among new spaces that comprise contemporary networked learning environments.  We know that museums and libraries are important nodes within these networked learning ecologies.  We also know that the museum is no longer considered to be located only in a particular physical space, but due to the development of new practices and services it now extends its presence through all sorts of virtual spaces on the WWW as well as in the transient spaces created through the diverse practices and technologies of mobility.   The distributed museum exists \"over\" the conceptual divides between physical and the virtual, the fixed and the mobile.  Moreover we consider a third axis of museum offerings that are situated on the continuum of \"making practices\" and engagements with DIY (do-it-yourself) culture.  Here we map a range of practices that include closed-ended, guided, making activities (interactives), as well as more open-ended exploratory ones (tinkering).  The presentation will take the form of a digital visualization of the creative inventory of practices that comprise the distributed museum."

Physical visits and the way in which visitors track around museums is currently much harder to monitor. This paper discusses the opportunity that mobile phone WiFi, Bluetooth and TMSI signals provide to allow visitor tracking. The resulting data has potentially great value to museums in understanding how exhibitions and museums spaces are used, in forming exhibition design, assessing the return on investment of interactives and even profiling visitors. Two pilot studies using comparative technologies will also be discussed."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "Like most cultural institution Web sites, the sites from BPOC member institutions have a significant emphasis on events - exhibitions, lectures, classes, tours, performances, etc. Commercial calendar products are often not flexible enough to meet the specific needs of the cultural heritage field, forcing many museums to make do with inadequate calendaring systems at great expense. For example: the complexities of scheduling events on-line for museums and cultural institutions (e.g. a tour that takes place every other Monday, except for holidays, when it happens on Tuesday) often leads to either inefficient or, on the other end of the spectrum, overly complex calendaring software that non-technical staff are loathe to embrace and technical staff are loathe to support. Balboa Park Online Collaborative has developed a calendar package for the Drupal platform that handles the complex date functions highlighted above and an additional layer for aggregating event content from multiple sites into a central portal. This half-day workshop is aimed at anyone with a Drupal based website with need as outlined above and for developers that are interested seeing an installation with an eye towards recreating this feature set on other open source CMS platforms.  Participants in the workshop should expect to learn: How standard Drupal handles events and calendaring How to install the BPOC calendar backend on a standalone website How to construct basic calendar views once the backend calendar is installed The concepts related to sharing content between Drupal websites How to install the BPOC calendar in a multi-institutional environment The workshop will aim to be highly interactive with conceptual information balanced with practical application via hands installs in a live server environment. Participants will require a laptop, ftp software and a general knowledge of Drupal or a similar CMS."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "Mobile applications have increasingly become a regular part of the outreach and engagement strategies of many cultural institutions. As smart phone use grows, some organizations have sought to go beyond typical mobile applications and integrate location-based and augmented reality technology as a way to further access to collections, create new methods for understanding and interpreting the items, and increase communication between the organizations and the communities they serve.   In Spring 2010, the City of Philadelphia Department of Records received an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up grant to investigate mobile augmented reality technology for use in displaying overlays of historic photographs on the current urban landscape. Users simply point the cameras on their smart phones at a location of interest and the historic photographs and selected data related to the site are automatically accessed right through the camera display. The project utilized the resources of PhillyHistory.org, a collaborative online database of historic photographs and maps from five Philadelphia area institutions, and the PhillyHistory.org smart phone web application, a location-based web app that provides access to the collections via iPhone and Android smart phones. As a growing number of museums and humanities institutions from Philadelphia to London to Sydney are turning their attention to new technologies like augmented reality to revitalize interest in their collections, this paper will examine the state of mobile augmented reality technology and its current and possible applications for use within cultural institutions. Through an exploration and evaluation of the successes and challenges of the Department of Records' augmented reality project, we will investigate how this technology can be applied to other archives and museums and whether such efforts have proven valuable as an engagement and outreach tool."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "In Summer 2010, two cultural heritage and new media scholars, Colleen Brogan and Zachary McCune, received a grant from AT&T and the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University to complete an intermedia documentary on an innovative international subject which addressed a critical need in society.  Brogan and McCune proposed to create a multimedia documentary on Gaelic Games, unique sports only played in Ireland with fierce political and historical ties to the culture and heritage of Ireland. They interviewed athletes, club directors, coaches, and historians and produced new media content through Wordpress, Twitter, Vimeo, Youtube, all of which were pooled into the project's main site, http://www.heritageatplay.org.  In the age of the Olympics when sports are seen as a universal language traversing all cultural boundaries, the team was interested in a country that fiercely protected and maintained their historic games. But also, McCune and Brogan understood that traditional documentary filmmaking, in the age of the Internet and all it's possibilities, was archaic and limited. The idea of making a documentary about Gaelic Games was novel and innovative, but the dedication to update the old system of documentary filmmaking was the critical need in cultural production which the team aspired to address. McCune was the first to use \"intermedia\" to describe their project, explaining that the documentary did not just exist in the final 32-minute final film product, but in the entire process and transparency of the project from start to finish and beyond.  McCune and Brogan are thrilled by the final product and thankful for the support of the cultural institutions who helped to make it possible: they have also recognized that this \"intermedia\" style could be profitable and useful for many cultural institutions, both in evaluation and documentation of existing programs, and creating new long-distance content or educational programs specifically tailored to make use of multiple web platforms working in tandem. The team is hopeful that a discussion of multiple-platform integration and intermedia usage in a cultural institution at the Museum and the Web 2011 conference will produce exciting future collaborations and opportunities to continue this type of work in partnership with institutions.  All of the Heritage at Play project is licensed Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution and the project is entirely dedicated to open source exchange and collaboration. "

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "As growing numbers of museums invite users to digitally tag online collection objects with key words, it is timely to examine the value that this practice can bring to the sector. These tags in their aggregate are known as 'folksonomies' and are broad user-derived classifications that are, at their heart, a form of communication.[1] As a collaborative process with no hierarchical structure,[2] folksonomies stand in opposition to traditional museum taxonomies, and present museums with new opportunities for gaining insight into, and interacting with, audiences. Further, folksonomies give the museum the opportunity to track historical public contributions to museum collection documentation, providing the sector with a possible new avenue for historical document analysis. Through recording evolving language and tag behaviour, folksonomies have the potential to become autonomously important to the museum in its study of people and written historical documentation.   Folksonomies can also provide the museum with a new method for gaining insight into the polysemic nature of online collection objects and for uniting disparate theoretical and practical frameworks of meaning in the online collection. This conceptual paper will present an exploratory examination of the value that folksonomies provide to the museum and gallery sector. Using Sydney's Powerhouse Museum and the fully Internet-based steve.museum as examples, it will demonstrate that incorporating folksonomies with traditional taxonomic museum classification systems provides the museum with an important new way through which to maintain and grow its relevance in the digital age.   The growing incorporation of folksonomies and other Web2.0 technologies into museum collections practice is a current and important issue for the sector to address and understand. Changes in the technological landscape occur more quickly than the associated theoretical analysis. Therefore investigation into the value that folksonomies provide the online museum collection gives important and timely context for this practice. This research offers an original perspective on these issues.   [1] Andrea Wei-Ching Huang and Tyng-Ruey Chuang, \"Social Tagging, Online Communication, and Peircean Semiotics: A Conceptual Framework,\" Journal of Information Science 35(2009): 341.

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "The recent proliferation of technologies and devices (including iPhone, iPad and alike) provides new perspectives for the use of multimedia applications for cultural heritage. Users are no more just sitting in front of their PC at home, but they also access multimedia information walking in the galleries or in archeological parks, sitting in a cafeteria, driving a car, travelling on a train, etc. In addition, and most important, all the different devices and technologies are important, and institutions can't anymore decide which are preferable for their users, who are free to choose according to their (permanent or temporary) needs. In relation to the above, this paper wants to raise two basic issues concerning: (1) effective authoring environments and (2) adaptation of content to different devices, technologies and situations of usage. The current generation of authoring environment is quite unsatisfactory. Many authoring tools are officially aimed at specific technologies for specific situations (for example, an iPhone in a gallery). Other tools are apparently aimed at multiple devices/technologies and multiple situations of usage, but they are actually biased towards a limited set of choices, especially as far as situations of usage are concerned (e.g. try to listen to a mobile guide for a gallery, while sitting at home) and their structure (information architecture) cannot be easily bended to fit new needs. The need for content adaptation is the other side of the same coin. It should take into account: The device (obviously) E.g. large screens can deliver a lot of visual information while small screens cannot even show an image's caption. Audio can be appropriate for a mobile device (e.g. the iPod in the car) but not for a touch table being used by many users in a large room. The user experience E.g. The user looking at an exhibit or at a virtual reproduction of it, does not need a detailed description, but rather a good interpretation. A user driving a car must get some kind of description, before digging into any interpretation. Cultural profile of the users (also obvious) Information filling cultural gaps may be needed, when specialized or not globally known cultures are dealt with. Very few users could relate well, for example, geographical or historical references concerning a small, far away country. The context of discourse A video that is consumed in the context of ARTBABBLE, for example, could be easily related to its context (i.e. which museum, which country, which exhibition, …). The same video in a \"vacuum\" (say on YOUTUBE) may need supplementary information. … In this paper, we will extensively discuss the above issues and present a general frame both for identifying the problems and for suggesting possible solutions. Real-life examples will be taken from \"Nippon\", a set of four different exhibitions (in different ways related to Japan) that take place in Lugano (Switzerland) from October 2010. A large variety of technologies is being used (web, podcast, iPhone-applications, Smartphone, iPad …). An innovative authoring environment has been developed to coordinate all the different productions. A novel \"adaption\" strategy is also being experimented. A user study (the results of which will be available at the time of the M&W conference), will allow to assess the impact upon the users."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "After the emergence of Web 2.0, online art museums have been evolving into participatory museums, in an attempt to increase the public's participation through the utilization of social media. Among many types of social media, social tagging has been receiving widespread attention as a tool for reducing the semantic gap between curators and visitors, through the group knowledge obtained from the active participation of the public. In this circumstance, Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art (GMOMA) embarked on an ongoing project with us to explore the potential of social tagging and applying it into museum management strategy. Since the end of 2009, we built our own tag database based on the collections from GMOMA, and experiments were carried out by building a testbed on a website that was created to collect tags of 128 pieces of artworks. After collecting the tags, we evaluated the feasibility of social tagging systems through workshops with curators from GMOMA. From the workshop we found the potentials of social tagging systems in museums through interviews and discussions with the curators, and identified the improvements that could be made in order to apply it to actual museums. However, we discovered that while the number of tags increased, social tagging systems showed limitations in providing meaningful information and supporting semantic relationships between tags and museum collections.   The causes are as follows:   Lack of order, structure and depth in tags Linguistic issues Free forms of tags can cause ambiguity, chaos and noise Spam tags Failure to show the semantic relationships between tags; only provides an alphabetical list   Thus to achieve a participatory web and reflect the visitors' semantic appreciation of museum collections, we conclude that the existing tagging systems should be supplemented. To improve the existing social tagging system and enhance the semantic appreciation in online art museum, our suggested solution is facetted tagging system which gives a guideline or schema to users when tagging the individual artworks. By collecting tags through the facetted tagging systems, we can automatically obtain a semantic structure and meaningful groups of tags. Before implementing the facetted tagging system and proving that it works, we had to make facets that cover the all the categories of art museum tags. We proceeded with card-sorting tests to extract and verify facets from the collected tag database. We retrieved six facets -\"Background, Identification, Theme, Association, Emotion and Figure\"- based on the semantic structure of tags, which were in a mess but now can be categorized into meaningful groups (facets).   Finally, user-tests are scheduled in order to prove that applying the six facets into the facetted tagging system can help to bridge the semantic gap between curators and audiences. For the user-tests, the same 128 artworks from the first experiment will be used, and we will compare the tags collected from the user-tests with the tags from the first experiment. Then we plan to discuss the feasibility of facetted tagging systems and its results - which we call structured tags - through a workshop with the curators from GMOMA."

    "abstract": "Mini-workshop   Abstract   How to measure and define the success of cultural websites and online services is a problem common to all parts of the cultural sector - museums, archives, galleries, arts organisations, libraries, publishers. Worse, funding agencies and government departments lack the expertise to offer guidelines or set standards. The result is a confusing mixture of statistics and reporting that reveals little about genuine user satisfaction.   In mid 2010 a group of 24 organisations and agencies from across the cultural heritage and arts sector in the UK began collaborating on a piece of action research addressing the issues around 'evaluating online success'. Coordinated by Culture24 and working with Seb Chan, the group of institutions have been developing a framework and best practice guide for measuring online projects both on organisational websites and those presented through social media channels.    This mini-wowrkshop will present the findings of the project to date, along with several case studies from partner institutions, anonymised where necessary, demonstrating the impact of metrics customisations, cross-sector audience segmentation, and benchmarking.   The full list of project partners is as follows -    Powerhouse Museum British Library National Gallery Science Museum                                             Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery                                 Tate                                                                               British Museum                                                                    Kew                                                                                        National Maritime Museum                                Imperial War Museum                                 National Portrait Gallery                                                                  Watershed                                                  Royal Shakespeare Company                 National Museums Scotland                                                              National Museum Wales                                                Design Museum                                      English Heritage     Roundhouse       DCMS Arts Council of England Heritage Lottery Fund Museums, Libraries & Archives Council (MLA) University of Leicester."

    "abstract": "The Balboa Park Online Collaborative (BPOC) was created to lead technology-focused cooperation between 20 Balboa Park institutions. One of the challenges BPOC quickly uncovered when it began, was a serious limitation to supporting collaboration caused by the lack of IT infrastructure necessary to network the institutions together. As a result, BPOC has installed the infrastructure necessary for a high speed (1GB/second) connection between the organizations, provide a 100mb internet connection and also provide a connection to CalREN, the California Research and Education Network to which the vast majority of the state's K-20 educational institutions are connected.  The connection to CalREN also provides connectivity to non-California institutions and industry research organizations such as Internet2, high-speed networks in Mexico and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities Networks. In the park, this network will allow BPOC to prove the concept of centralized storage and backup, server virtualization, and shared application resources. Outside of the park, BPOC members will be able to provide and access content with all of the educational institutions on the various networks, opening up the knowledge that resides in the member institutions while enabling them to utilize resources typically only available at the university level.  This Paper will describe the park environment, the options reviewed for connecting the institutions together, different vendor solutions to the problem, the deployment and lessons learned."

    "abstract": "This paper will discuss the role that tangible artefacts in the context of an interactive multi-device installation have as mediators between the physical visitor experience of an open-air museum and the layer of digital information that is available to them about the site. We will refer to the case study of an installation -\"Reminisce\"- that we have designed for an Irish open-air museum, Bunratty Folk Park, where participants could follow trails around the site on the footsteps of characters from Ireland's past. At different historic houses, visitors could collect \"tokens\" related to the characters both in digital and physical form: audio recordings of personal memories downloaded to a smart phone application, and physical tokens representing aspects of the characters' lives (such as traditional recipes, chunks of turf, hanks of wool, etc). The physical tokens had a double purpose: that of providing visitors with a physical \"anchoring\" to the houses and a tangible representation of their progress along the trail; and that of acting as \"keys\" to unlocking further digital content at a specific site. Concealed RFID tags were included in the tokens to enable this functionality. In the paper we will describe the installation in more detail and, by means of examples from the body of data documenting the visitors' experience of \"Reminisce\", we will discuss in detail the role that the tangible artefacts had in bridging the \"digital\" and \"physical\" spaces of the installation, as well as extracting some recommendations for designing installations in the setting of living history sites."

    "abstract": "A History of the World in 100 Objects was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 100 15-minute programmes divided into 3 series in the Spring, Summer and Autumn of 2010. Presented by Neil McGregor, Director of the British Museum, each programme investigated in depth an object from the Museum\\'s collection and through the year formed a narrative that told a history of our world from man\\'s first artefact, the handaxe to the present day (the identity of the 100th object has not been made public at the time of writing). This paper takes a brief look at the history of collaborations between museums and broadcasters, before going to present how the BBC and BM project team developed a digital offer (centred on www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld) that both supported and extended the core programmes, building on the central idea that objects have a unique power to tell stories and make connections across the globe. The paper will discuss the arc of the project in the three spheres - on air, online and onsite at the British Museum and in museums across the UK -  and show how the project was developed and sustained in the build-up to the first broadcast and throughout the year, on Radio 4 and other BBC radio and TV channels, the A History of the World and British Museum websites, the blog, mobile site, and social media sites. In addition to the core 100 British Museum objects, the project extended to include contributions from over 500 museums across the UK and several thousand individuals, who uploaded their object and its story to the site- both online, at schools and at events throughout the UK. We will also discuss some of the issues encountered during the scoping of the digital components- particularly focusing on maintaining the centrality of the broadcast offer, while opening it out to wider contribution and ownership - both that of partner museums and the public. We will then conclude by assessing the reach and impact of this unique project, and look how it can be used as a model of future public service partnerships between broadcasters and cultural organisations in a digital era."

The breadth and reach of the Internet and the availability of alternative data sources, whether they are harvested programmatically or fashioned by amateur communities of interest has created a world where both the conceptual and financial economics of traditional scholarship are rapidly being undermined. Further, in the absence of a way for non-experts to feel as though they can participate in the discourse outside of established venues and vocabularies the opinions and assumed meritocracies of experts are increasingly being overlooked entirely. What would it mean to change the role of digital preservation and scholarly interpretation from one where it looks and feels, to those the outside, like castle walls to be more like a rough guide composed of road signs and fence-posts? To consider a project whose goal is no longer to weave elaborate tapestries of the past facts but to produce textiles, and patterns, to be fashioned into reflections of the present?"

Scholarly research, technical innovation, curatorial enquiry, educational strategy, enterprise analytics, user-centred design and crowd-sourcing were just some of the methods employed by numerous teams across Tate on various projects. Over the course of two years these sometimes unconnected activities were identified, shaped and successfully channelled into a unified online representation of art and artists. The quirky trajectory of multiple projects will be charted as resources are diverted, goals mature and priorities change. As well as the most successful endeavours, we will encounter failed initiatives, inconsistent progress, abandoned contexts and reconfigured methodologies, all set against an increasingly pressurised budgetary landscape and an unpredictable change of government. The finished site will act as a guide for these narratives, demonstrating the outcomes of completed efforts and acting as a live metric for the projects' goals and priorities. Future components will be discussed in the relevant contexts, and longer term plans revealed. Case studies to be referred to include:            ArtMap            Taxonomic structures            Online Scholarly Cataloguing Initiative            User commenting            Personal collections            Archive integration            Tate Channel            Article syndication            Displays information            Curatorial style guide            Image sizes            User testing            Audience research            Social media integration Through discussion of these projects we will discover the scale and complexity of the finished product, the challenges of integrating many years worth of content created for other contexts, and the ongoing implications for a public institution that integrated digital workflows over a decade ago.   A open assessment will be given of the budgetary and personnel requirements, along with the institutional impact of Tate's Online Strategy 2010-12.

It is hoped that the Decipher project will result in a reasoning engine, virtual environment and interfaces that can help curators and visitors to present digital heritage objects as part of a coherent narrative that is directly related to a user's interests. This will allow the user to interactively assemble, visualise and explore, not just collections of objects, but the knowledge structures that connect and give them meaning."

    "abstract": "Many museums have been busy building APIs since the Brookyln Museum set the example, and in 2009 the Powerhouse made the decision to offer a much of its collection data downloadable as a data dump. The decision was primarily a pragmatic one, as the Museum wanted to test the waters and examine how the data might be best used before dedicating resources to developing a full API. The release of data was timed to coincide with a number of 'government 2.0' activities occurring in Australia, and it was hoped that by providing downloadable data, it would be used in government 2.0 mashup contest. In the end, several individuals in the contests did make use of the data - the most notable being Flip Explorer, a dynamic catalogue created for in-gallery use by two developers who were not known to the Powerhouse. However the best usage was by the Digital NZ project that incorporated it into their search - thus providing access across many New Zealand websites.   Drawing on the in-sector work of Bernstein (2008), Ellis (2008, 2009), and Morgan (2009) as well as that of Digital NZ; as well as similar APIs provided by Flickr, Open Library, OCLC Worldcat and others,  the Powerhouse has reconsidered the appropriate functionality of a museum API.   As the Powerhouse had already deployed several techniques to add value and meaning to the collection data - 'folksonomic' tags drawn both from the Powerhouse site and the Flickr Commons, as well as Flickr comments and geolocation data (and more) about objects, as well as semantic information mined using Thompson Reuters' Calais Tagging API; and an extensive log of the relationships between search terms and objects - it was decided that this structured data should also be made available.   This is in stark contrast to the original data dump that simply contained a subset of descriptive fields about collection objects. Thus the enhanced API allows access into our collection from the starting point of themes, collections, categories, subjects and object popularity rather than just objects.   Drawing on the work of Chan (2010) the API use and its resulting output is able to be tracked in some detail, allowing the Museum to monitor the return on investment of the the provision of the API service.   This paper looks at how the API launched in 2010 quantitatively and qualitatively improves upon the access provided by the data dump, as well as how the tracking methods were built into the API to ensure that the project is best able to adapt to the user needs of API developers. It provides details on the lessons learned and suggests best practices for API development in the cultural sector.  "

    "abstract": "Flickr Commons launched in 2008 as a platform for enhancing the discoverability of cultural heritage collections and for allowing users to tag, annotate, and repurpose these materials. The Commons now boasts 46 members and tens of thousands of public domain images. The impact of the project has been monumental. Many of the institutions involved can boast hit counts on their Flickr images that far exceed other digital collections. While many of the numbers are certainly impressive, it can be argued that they are one of the least compelling statistics. What, then, are the most meaningful statistics for a project that puts library collections in a highly visible space outside the library's traditional confines? Some of our standard and more established metrics, such as hit counts, only illuminate a small part of the story - the bigger picture includes the myriad ways users have interacted with our images, by adding notes and comments, by including them in their own curated galleries, by tweeting them, and referencing them on their blogs. There are limitless possibilities for users to interact with digital materials and we should be developing metrics that reflect this landscape. This panel will examine multiple approaches to assessing the impact of a digital library collection that exists beyond an institution's borders.   Dianne Dietrich, Physics & Astronomy Librarian, Physical Sciences Library, Cornell University Library Joe Dalton, Applications Developer, Office of Strategic Planning, The New York Public Library Helena Zinkham, Head, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress Effie Kapsalis, Head of Web & New Media Smithsonian Photography Initiative/Smithsonian Institution Paula Bray, Manager, Visual & Digitisation Services, Powerhouse Museum."

    "abstract": "We have been trying to bring the science center's experience to the Web, at Science Museums of Coruña(Spain). After some years of trying many little things, we have no magic formula and we only know something for sure: the whole institution website is a tough place to start (and tougher in our case, considering that we are three different museums under the same brand: mc2). So, instead of trying to bring the whole museum to the web, we thought of bringing just an exhibition. Instead of redesigning our whole website, we started creating a new microsite to complement the exhibition: \"To the astonishment of Mr. Darwin\". Our approach to an exhibition website tries to go beyond the concept of \"electronic brochure\". Rather than translating the exhibition's brochure to a web page we tried to develop a multimedia-content viewer, with quick and simple navigation.  More than creating and intuitive multimedia experience, our main goal was taking to the Web the idea of an exhibit, which is the core of our museums' experience: an interactive element to explore, play, wake up curiosity, make questions and start to look for the answers. So we decided to go and hunt visitors where they are wandering around in the Internet: in places like YouTube, Facebook or Twitter. The point was using social networks and Web 2.0 services to create interactive online experiences, that connect people with ideas. These 2.0 exhibits are the core of the microsite we would like to demonstrate at this conference. The web of the exhibition\"To the astonishment of Mr. Darwin\" has a launch date set on February 12th, 2011, to celebrate Darwin's 202 birthday. MisterDarwin.eu is a multilingual web (english, spanish and galician), born to complement the physical exhibition but with its own value, to estimulate curiosity arond Darwin and evolution. We hope to get people want to visit the exhibition but we also try to reach bigger audiences. We plan to create a platform based on this microsite, to easily develop websites for our other flagship exhibitions. We are building the tools to get the museum's staff (our content developers) doing most of that work: creating and updating the online exhibits. We also want this platform to be open to other institutions' participation, in a near future. But, first of all, we would like to share our work, doubts, accomplishments, frustrations, needs... with other colleagues and learn of other different approaches of bringing the museum to the Web."

    "abstract": "When the first handheld devices became commercially available, museums were particularly excited about the opportunities that these could offer particularly in terms of visitors\\' orientation and way finding. The presence of a touch screen, in fact, supports the use of interactive maps, which, alone or in combination with location aware technologies can help visitors understand where they are and decide where to go. More than 10 years have now passed since the implementation of the first handheld guide and, unfortunately, many museums are still struggling to develop and implement effective way finding solutions on mobile platforms. Location aware technologies have proven to be expensive and problematic to install and maintain, while interactive maps, particularly of complex sites can be challenging for people to use and interpret on small screens. Building on the experience of other institutions such as Tate, the Met and the Louvre, the British Museum has recently launched a multimedia guide in 11 languages that supports way finding and orientation without relying on location aware technology. In this paper, we will present in details the various way finding solutions that were developed for the guide, as well as the results of research and evaluations that were carried out on these applications during and after the launch.  Through our experience, we hope to provide a reference for other medium and large size museums, which are grappling with similar issues."

    "abstract": "Artists have been using the internet since the early days of the Web, but no-one has done anything quite like Chinese artist Ai Weiwei who uses technology, Twitter in particular, as a way of sharing his artistic and political life with people all around the world.  Alongside his Unilever Series installation at Tate Modern, which opens October 12th 2010, the Turbine Hall has also been transformed into a hub of global conversation. Here, next to the artwork, a series of booths have been installed where the artist asks visitors to record a video, either asking him a question or answering one of his questions. These videos are then published on a dedicated website for all to see and to also engage those not able to visit in person. Each week until May 2011, Ai Weiwei is selecting videos to respond to and posting his video or text responses on the website, thus creating a joyful, worldwide dialogue between the artist and the visitors. People outside the museum can also join in the conversation via Twitter. Ai Weiwei will be monitoring and replying to postings with the hashtag #tateaww. In this paper, we will describe in detail the principles, philosophy and technology behind the One-to-One with the artist project. Recent advances in the technology made it possible to realize the project's ambitions in under eight weeks. We will also report on the effective usage of the kiosks and website by both the visitors and the artist, the challenges encountered in the development and implementation process, as well as the results of the evaluation that will be carried out in the upcoming months."

    "abstract": "Just as personal and collective memories imbue artifacts with significance, so it is with place. Launched in January 2010, PhilaPlace is a collaborative and interactive community-oriented Web site that connects stories to places across time throughout Philadelphia's neighborhoods, creating an enduring record of collective heritage. Through the integration of two open source solutions-Google Maps and Collective Access collections management system-PhilaPlace supports a rich feature set that facilitates an interpretive mosaic of historical records as well as stories, photos, and video shared by ordinary people of all backgrounds. This paper focuses on the potential of current open-source technologies, advances in GIS mapping, and increased access to archival and community-curated content to situate and visualize the history of a place in innovative ways. The PhilaPlace platform affords a rich opportunity for closer inspection and evaluation as a potentially viable model and reproducible platform for broader application within the museum and historical center world (AnyPlace). Our evaluation focuses on an iterative design review of not only the technological design solution but also the project methodology. How might the open-source solutions and institutional partnerships for PhilaPlace inform an AnyPlace approach to mapping and interpreting place-based historical narrative for neighborhoods in other towns and cities? Do evaluation results support the use of this methodology and platform as a reusable model, and what value does such a platform bring to the audiences who engage with it? Also included in our discussion are the lessons learned in developing PhilaPlace, in particular issues of sustainability, institutional capacity, and the changing pace of technological innovation."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is the development of a navigation system that will help enhance appreciation for urban art by connecting viewers with other people's thoughts and opinions of art pieces. Hiroshima, located in western Japan, has many works of public art that have assumed a theme of peace. However, in Japan, it seems that the appreciation of art is restricted to the elite, and the majority of people do not seem interested enough to visit art museums. We have designed a system that allows users to share an appreciation of public art in urban spaces by using their mobile phones. The main characteristics of this study  were to build a system that:- ?induced a positive appreciation among users ?enabled the sharing of text and images ?heightened user-experience through involvement ?was  based on User-centered design and had provisions for color blindness. The system which we have designed has been tested and improved on three occasions to date and is targeted at those who have few opportunities to appreciate art. The repetition of this experiment within the confines of Hiroshima City, found that the experience of public art was enhanced through the use of this mobile phone system.  These results would seem to indicate that public art pieces do benefit the average person who rarely visits museums in a positive way."

    "abstract": "Starting in early 2009, SFMOMA embarked on an ambitious plan to bring the production, publishing and distribution of its mobile tour in-house. This meant investing in a fleet of Apple iPod Touches, scripting and producing hours of new audio and multimedia content, and adopting a new authoring system to custom craft the user experience.    In the eighteen months since we began developing the new tour, innovations in the mobile app space have grabbed tech headlines everywhere.  More and more, users of iPhones and other mobile devices want to know: can I download this to my own phone?  (or: Why can't I??)  If we'd started our development a year later, or even a few months, we might have given that question more serious consideration --  but in time, teeming masses of developers descended on the app space and quickly proved that solutions to this problem could be within our reach.    Now with our home-grown mobile tour in place, we need to design a streamlined approach to serving our visitors in-house both with our devices and their own.  We also need to keep in mind the thousands of web visitors who use and enjoy our online content via SFMOMA's website or RSS feeds - an audience we have paid less attention to since we began our push into the in-gallery handheld space. How do can we produce and publish our multimedia content to reach the broadest audience?  How can we measure the value of our mobile-designed content for web visitors? And how can we optimize content designed for in-gallery use when it is being experienced -- by app or by webpage -- far from the museum?   Finally, most of our mobile stops are crafted for multiple delivery platforms: 1) the in-house mobile multimedia tour, 2) download via RSS, 3) Guide-by-cell, and 4) an app for iPhone and Android platforms.  Many of these same stops are also published to our website.  Is there a one-size-fits-all solution to creating mobile content for multiple platforms?  What are the considerations for different audiences and different platforms? "

By borrowing this design approach from print publications and applying it to the web, a common and simplified language can be utilized by all members of a web site team Free templates are available online to serve as starting points for creating sites with a fixed number of columns (usually twelve or sixteen). Designers are then freed to focus on style more than layout, developers can create powerful layouts simply by assigning CSS classes expressing column size, and content creators can use simple tools to create rich text and image layouts using the same column convention. All parties involved can speak a simplified column number sizing system as opposed to pixel dimensions. We will show how the Indianapolis Museum of Art has been using this technique to optimize our web development efforts in addition to WYSIWYG and WIKI tools that enable content authors."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the different strategies that may be used to develop museum games by focusing on two case studies currently underway at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The type of game and game play are the basic structural components of the game. Much like the narrative of a story, the game components must support the desired outcomes. Lack of clear definition of outcomes early in the design process may lead to games that do not address those outcomes. In addition, assessment is critical to understanding whether the game was successful and achieved the project goals. This paper reviews the different approaches taken by the development team in order to reach the educational goals and the methods of assessment incorporated into the projects from the outset. The Rochester Institute of Technology and the Luce Center for American Art at the Smithsonian partnered together last year to create a prototype Facebook game application, myMuseum. A museum outreach tool in the form of a Facebook game, myMuseum incorporates contact zones and third space theory[1] to develop a model that would: Engage nontraditional audiences Provide interactive and meaningful access to digitized collections Stimulate museum-community interaction Teach basic terms and cognitive skills necessary to engage with museum objects Change the perception of the museum from authoritative to collaborative The second project is a role playing game (RPG) prototype being developed by RIT and the University of Delaware. In contrast to myMuseum, the Venerable Historian uses a quest type narrative structure to incorporate specific educational goals and outcomes for material culture education. The quest structure allows for the incorporation of the formal assessment methods required by educators working within post-secondary and higher education. The goals of the Venerable historian were to: Create a tool that could be used both informally and incorporated into formal learning curricula for young adults Develop different styles of quest narratives that combine high levels of engagement and achieve learning objectives Bring together the multidisciplinary approaches used to study material culture in order to give students a broader understanding of the material RPGs allow the player to immerse themselves in the world of the game. The game narrative is advanced through interactive quests that engage the player within the process. The Venerable Historian prototype focuses on the incorporation and assessment of pedagogical goals within some standard RPG quest formats and on finding the right balance between engagement (fun) and learning.   [1] Goins, \"Museum Games and the Third Space.\" Michigan State University, 2010. http://meaningfulplay.msu.edu/proceedings2010/mp2010_paper_26.pdf."

    "abstract": "In this paper, the case of an innovative Dutch think-tank for the cultural sector is described. The Heritage Innovators Network (INE in Dutch) is unique in the Netherlands. For the first time, creative thinkers from cultural heritage institutions come together every month and discuss current topics in their sector, such as crowdsourcing, interaction with the public, and open content. The discussions and results of these sessions have successfully influenced and spread innovative ideas and solutions for cultural institutions. The INE is an offline platform created for and by cultural heritage professionals. The project has been carried out within the scope of Images for the Future, one of the largest digitisation efforts in Europe to date. This paper will focus on how a bottom-up approach leads to a think-tank for innovative solutions for cultural heritage institutions. An offline platform for online solutions The Dutch cultural heritage sector is not yet exploring all the possibilities of the digital domain to its fullest. Often the activities of heritage institutions are limited to digitising the collections and filling image databases with this content. At the same time there is a strong drive to innovate and experiment in the Dutch cultural heritage sector. But often the will and enthusiasm is carried by just a few individual frontrunners in the field that do not have the support in their organizations to implement new ideas, strategies or experiments with new media. An often heard excuse is that there is no basis, not enough budget and too little manpower to work out a good strategy. INE has evolved into an inspiring national platform where individuals with innovative ideas meet, share ideas and come up with possible solutions with their own knowledge and tools. Innovation, inspiration and entrepreneurship through the power within! How we made it work Since January 2010 INE has organized meetings on a monthly basis in Dutch museums and archives. The INE network has 50 active members representing heritage organisations nationwide who attend in different combinations these meetings. Members take part in the INE personally, not as representative of their institutions, but with the intent to co-operate and co-create. The meetings are organised and hosted by one of the member's institutions and co-organised by a small group of initiators. The host institution is responsible for the theme or agenda of a meeting. An online meetup-platform serves as forum, source for inspiration and a share point for knowledge and ideas. Regular IRL meetings have proven to be a viable solution for bringing together the communal ideas and visions of this group of front runners who often battle a lonely battle in their own organisations. The themed meetings often provide concrete solutions one or more organisations can use in their daily digital routine, thereby strengthening inter-institutional cooperation, and rising above the pitfall of being just a think-tank. The INE prevents members from reinventing the wheel over and over again by joining forces both online and offline. Challenges for the INE after his first successful year is how to go beyond usable ideas for some institutions towards solutions for the whole sector and expanding the enthusiasm deeply felt by members beyond the monthly meetings and deeper into their organisations."

    "abstract": "In the spring of 2010, the Virtual Museum of Canada (VMC) at the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) witnessed a viral Internet phenomenon. One seemingly innocuous photo from the Bralorne Pioneer Museum in central British Columbia, hosted on our servers in a http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=exhibit_home&fl=0&lg=English&ex=00000470\" target=\"_blank\">virtual exhibition exploded online. From one post on Digg.com, the image radiated across the web through personal blogs, popular news sources like Fark.com and Gizmodo.com, and across \"traditional\" social media networks. International media outlets were requesting information and interviews, and web-savvy entrepreneurs were asking for high resolution copies of the photo hoping to be the first to solve the mystery and capitalize on the image.  CHIN's Business Development and Marketing team followed the story online for months, an exercise which was instrumental in helping the organization develop a more comprehensive and integrated social media strategy beyond traditional channels and social media applications. While CHIN watched the VMC visitation statistics climb exponentially, at the same time, it also recognized that sometimes what is put online can move out of a museum's control, and that institutions may be sceptical in their approach to social media. In this case, as our intellectual property moved further out into the Web, the further it became its own brand, removed from both CHIN and the Bralorne Museum. This is particularly poignant in this era where the jury is still out on fair use and the posting of full resolution images online. Any museum would welcome this flood of conversational capital, but to monitor this wave and try to bring it back to the institution's name can become an unexpected human resource cost and a frustrating exercise. Most importantly, the organization-models of larger institutions often do not allow museums to move at the speed of the conversations around them in social media channels, and keeping up with this minute-by-minute pace can be challenging. This paper presents the mystery of the \"1940s Time Traveller\" as a case study in viral phenomena and social media, and their potential implications for and impact on museums and cultural institutions. Should museums remain focused on ownership and copyright, or would their collections and knowledge be put to better and broader use by opening up? It also explores online museum marketing in an era where the phrase \"I Can Has Cheezburger?\" can launch million dollar online companies, an aftershave ad campaign can crash YouTube, and a photo can propel a small community museum to international recognition."

    "abstract": "This paper will examine the notion of the content economy where digital assets are the new currency for museums.  Our collections have always been central to our existence and mission, the content economy is only increasing the importance of collections.  The availability of digital assets both collection and non collection is critical to our success online as part of the visitor experience onsite-online & offsite. Digitisation has been a central issue for large institutions with legacy collections and the ante is well and truly up; from Museum Victoria's perspective content development partnerships have provided a somewhat unexpected means to an end.  l will use a number of examples of effective partnerships that have achieved significant project outcomes to the partners whilst also achieving our digitisation aims. Australia has developed a number of effective national partnerships, the Collections Australia Network (CAN-AMOL), the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the National Libraries TROVE project will be used to demonstrate the positives of collaboration and its benefits, challenges and outcomes. I will also use examples from Museum Victoria and its partnership with the Victorian State Education Department - specifically the Biodiversity Snapshots Project. We are all increasingly relying on partnerships and \"cartels\" to build our reputations and maintain our share of online audiences.  The notion of digital currency and the content economy is affecting museums dramtically. The changes wrought by the rise of ubiquitious computing are washing over our institutions - mobile as the dominant interaction point with our online content is yet another major shift - we are in my opnion making the most of the opportunities afforded by this latest technology shift. The real issue comes back to change, how are Museums delivering content in the changed environment - content economy means we must align our museums to produce content in a more nimble and cost effective way.  My message will be a positive one, I believe we are responding and growing in maturity and exerting more control over our operating enviroments."

    "abstract": "Why, with the vast resources, and fundamental human subjects at our disposal, have museums failed to make more than a handful of really compelling games? Are we too wedded to the idea that games must be educational? Do we lack the in-house skills to make subject matter and game engines gel, or are we simply trying to enter an overcrowded marketplace with too few resources? Should we leave making games to the professionals? At Wellcome Collection, we are beginning the process of making games for our website that put compelling gameplay at the centre of the experience, building our subject matter and resources around that experience. Games have their own logics and structure, and there's no reason these should be subjugated to narrow educational aims any more than the physical layout of the museum should determine the information architecture of our websites. The playful and exploratory impulses that draw gamers towards great games are still largely untapped as a means of engagement. Using the mini-workshop format, we will present our progress to date and open up a discussion of other museums' experience, sharing our ideas and understanding of games. We will use simple exercises to look at matching our available resources (narratives, photography, object databases) to modes of gameplay, as well as investigating reusable game engines, game syndication, and building enthusiasm for games inside the organisation."

The aim of this paper is to examine how the Danish museums understand and approach online communication with a focus on the use of social media. So far, the empirical based knowledge of how museums' actually act online in terms of social media is very scarce. This study will provide new insights into the field of digital museum communication and point to challenges of the present museum website categories by and ask if we need new categories to describe the museums online presence and communication. The paper will take its point of departure in an outline of the Danish online museum landscape through an analysis of the museums' online content. This includes the presentation of the results of a content analysis of all the 123 state-owned and state-subsidized museums' websites and a study of the museums' use of social media. The content analysis focuses on the use of images, videos and sound effects or podcasts on the museum websites. The scope is to analyze how the Danish museums present themselves online and to discuss whether or not German media researcher Werner Schweibenz' four museum website categories (brochure, object, learning, and virtual museum) cover the reality of today's online museum communication. The main part of the paper will, with Facebook as an example, examine the museums' presence on and use of social media platforms, examining different cases of Danish museums' interaction and communication on Facebook. According to Facebook's own statistics, Denmark is one of countries with the highest percentage of users per capita and every second Danish internet user has a Facebook profile. Hence, the outreach potentials for the Danish museums are presumably high. The initial results of the investigation of the museums' social media use show, that half of all the Danish museums are present on Facebook, typically with a 'like' page, but a marginal number of museums also have a profile or a group. The paper will also use data from interviews with museum professionals and Facebook users and a content analysis of selected museums' Facebook 'like' pages, profiles, and groups. The final paper will analyze how Facebook as a social network site with its specific design and interface and possibilities of interacting create both great potentials and barriers for when the museums interact and communicate online. In addition to the above mentioned survey of Danish museums online, this paper will draw on data from my Ph.D. project on Online Museum Communication from a User Perspective and on new and unique data from a national survey of the Danish Museums' Web Users (2010) by The Heritage Agency of Denmark."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "The scholarly catalogue has long been a critical part of a museum's mission, providing authoritative information about collection objects for scholars, students, and the general public. Often based on years of painstaking research and richly illustrated, print catalogues form one of the building blocks of art history. The catalogue's print form, however, is arguably the very component that prevents it from realizing even greater potential. High cost and relatively small print runs limit its accessibility, and printed books cannot easily change to reflect new acquisitions or new scholarly knowledge. While the online environment holds much promise for making collection catalogues more current, interactive, and widely available, museums still face significant financial and organizational challenges in making the transition online. Funded by the Getty Foundation, this five-year initiative aims to explore the potential for scholarly collection catalogues in an online environment, determine the institutional resources needed, and support the creation of replicable models. Specifically, whether the online delivery of scholarly catalogues can:    Offer a more dynamic relationship between a catalogue's research, publication, and re-publication phases; Directly link a wide array of primary and secondary resources to the record of a work of art, resources ranging from archival and conservation documentation to audio and video interviews; Make greater use of comparative images, including the ability to zoom in on details or present three-dimensional views of sculptural objects. Eight museums have received support: SFMOMA, AIC, Seattle Art Museum, the Tate, the Walker, LACMA, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery and are now entering the implementation phase. A selection of institutions will present their findings and approaches to these challenging questions."

    "title": "Cultural Data Sculpting: Omni-spatial Visualization for Large Scale Heterogeneous Datasets",
    "author": "Sarah Kenderdine, Timothy Hart",
    "url": null,
    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a three research projects currently underway to develop new omni-spatial visualization strategies for the collaborative interrogation of large-scale heterogeneous cultural datasets using the worlds' first 360-degree stereoscopic visualization environment (Advanced Visualization and Interaction Environment - AVIE). The AVIE system enables visualization modalities through full body immersion, stereoscopy, spatialized sound and camera-based tracking. The research integrates ground-breaking work by a renowned group of international investigators in virtual environment design, immersive interactivity, data visualization, museology, cultural analytics and computational linguistics.  The work is being implemented at the newly established world-leading research facility, City University's Applied Laboratory for Interactive Visualization and Embodiment - ALIVE), <http://www.cityu.edu.hk/scm/alive>.  For researchers currently, interactive, immersive and collaborative techniques to explore large-scale datasets lack adequate experimental development essential to the construction of knowledge in analytic discourse (Pike et al 2009). Recent visualization research remains constrained to 2D small-screen based analysis and advances interactive techniques of \"clicking\", \"dragging\" and \"rotating\" (Lee et al 2009, Speer et al 2010:9) Furthermore, the number of pixels available to the user remains a critical limiting factor in human cognition of data visualizations (Kasik et al, 2009). The increasing trend towards research requiring 'unlimited' screen resolution has resulted in the recent growth of gigapixel displays (e.g. Powerwall) and next generation CAVE systems (e.g. StarCave, DeFanti et al 2009). The opportunities offered by interactive and 3D technologies for enhanced cognitive exploration and interrogation of high dimensional data still need to be realized within the domain of visual analytics and digital humanities (Kenderdine, 2010). The three projects described take on these core challenges of visual analytics inside AVIE to provide powerful modalities for an omni-directional exploration of multiple textual datasets, archaeological laser scan data and museum collections responding to the need for embodied interaction; knowledge-based interfaces, collaboration, cognition and perception and, narrative coherence (as identified in Pike et al, 2009). Within the museum, the rapid growth in participant culture has seen creative production overtake data access as the primary motive for interaction with databases and search engines. The meaning of diverse bodies of data is increasingly expressed through the user's creative exploration and re-application of data, rather than through the simple access to information. Through AVIE, museum users investigate the quality of narrative coherence brought to interactive navigation and re-organization of information. Databases and projects included in this paper: (1) Western Han Tomb archaeological data; (2) Museum Victoria multimedia rich records (30,000); (3) multilingual datasets including the Tripitaka Koreana in Classical Chinese (the world's largest single corpus composed of 52 million glyphs on 83,000 printing blocks, carved in Korea in the 13th century); New Testament in Greek and English and Chinese; Bible in Hebrew and; Qur'an in Arabic. Even though this work takes place largely \"off the web\" it seeks to provide new visualization paradigms that scale, cross-platform. In addition, partners in Australia, Hong Kong, USA and Germany, with AVIE style systems can be connected together for collaborative distributed access.   Collaborators: Museum Victoria, City University of Hong Kong, ALiVE, UNSW, UC San Diego, UC Merced UC Berkeley, Electronic Cultrual Atlas Initiative, ZKM, Jiaotong University, Tufts University ?Link:"

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "There are around 1000 museums in Finland. According to the National Board of Antiquities there are 163 professionally run museums, which are responsible for 326 places open to public[1]. However, there are around 600 smaller museums[2], which cannot afford to digitize and make their collections accessible to a wider audience. The author's preliminary study has shown that online accessibility and attractiveness of cultural heritage in these small, local Finnish museums is very limited. However, the local museums are very eager to use available Internet solutions to present their collections and communicate with their audience. ViMuseo (Finnish VirtuaaliMuseo means \"virtual museum\") is a project developed at the Department of Art and Culture Studies at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. The main objectives of the research are: (1) to investigate the possibilities of new media in presenting cultural heritage in small museums; (2) to analyze the cooperation between the researcher, graphic designers and programmers; and (3) to construct the tool to create multimedia presentations. Participartory design and action research methods are used in this research. During the demonstration the basic functionalities of ViMuseo will be explained. ViMuseo is an online tool to create multimedia presentations, virtual exhibitions and projects. It is designed for the institutions without digitized resources, which want to be more active in the internet. The tool is a content management system, implemented as a Web application (Web CMS). It is developed with programmers and graphic designers. There are two version of the system: http://www.virtuaalimuseo.fi/04/ and http://vimuseo.fi/08 The system and its interface are user friendly and its usage does not require any professional knowledge of programming. Users (the institutions' representatives) may register and describe their institutions in a predefined way. They may add objects and use them to create virtual collections, exhibitions and projects. Each object may be constructed by providing textual description, adding Google maps, images, flash animations, movies, music files and downloadable files in most common formats. In this way, the user creates multimedia presentations, which can be used to create virtual collections, exhibitions and projects. A few examples of social tools will also be implemented and tested (comments, tags and Facebook Open Graph). ViMuseo is a non-commercial project. At this moment, as a part of the author's doctoral research, it serves only to investigate possibilities of new media and their implementation in local institutions. In 2010 the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture has constituted the working group to investigate the situation of the Finnish regional museums and the possible development tools. If many problems are solved, ViMuseo.fi can be potentially developed as a working system serving local museums. The research is supported by the grants from the Department of Art and Cultural Studies, University of Jyväskylä, Finland. This project would not be possible without the help of the Jyväskylä University Museum[3], which provides all the necessary materials and support.

    "abstract": "This paper is a user evaluation of a mobile phone audio guide, developed for visitors to use at the National Gallery of Denmark. The audio guide is offered as a downloadable MP3 file at every incoming visitor who is carrying a mobile phone with an open bluetooth connection. The guide itself is structured through association, offering an experience more comparable to an audio documentary than a traditional guided tour. Instead of directing the visitor's focus of attention to selected points and objects provided by the museum as a producer, the sound collage relates indirectly to the objects of the exhibition, emphasizing visitors' agency and authorship. The paper reports on a number of strategies developed by visitors experiencing an unfamiliar guide structure. These strategies reflect a conflict between the initial expectation of guiding instructions and the freedom of making choices according to personal interest, and a conflict between the expectation of a learning experience rather than an aesthetic experience. The results indicate that most visitors are able to make sense of the guide and to use it successfully, in different ways, to enrich their visit. The evaluation also shows that visitors are fund of using their own mobile phones - but they have several problems with their phones in downloading the MP3 file (accepting the file, finding the file, memory problems, etc.)."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "In January 2011, the Victoria and Albert Museum will relaunch its website, with a new design based upon a radically different approach to content which will make users the central focus of the site. It will do this by moving from a static hierarchical navigation structure to a dynamic concept-driven site which will gather the available content relevant to a user's subject of interest. When presenting this to the user, museum content will be integrated with user-generated content and content from third-party sites using semantic web technologies, all of which will be returned in a number of ways including using the activity of users to link content. A number of diverse content systems were used to achieve this, including open source systems such as MySource Matrix and Drupal, in-house systems and third-party services such as Vimeo and Delicious. This paper will examine the development of the overall range of content management processes to control the new site, and will offer a more detailed look at one of these, the development of an in-house tagging system. It will also examine what happens when you mix up web content from organisational and other sources to demonstrate the effect of these processes on real-life web pages. Who should attend? Staff who manage web content, who want to know about creating a dynamically-driven site using a number of different content sources to deliver a consistent experience for their users, or are interested in the use of tagging.  It does not cover technical development although this may be mentioned where relevant. Format The paper offers a case study of the content management issues that arose during the project, with the focus very much on the practical experience.  The presentation will describe the key issues identified, how new processes were developed to address these issues, what worked and what did not and where compromises had to be made, with hints and tips included throughout A central theme is how best to present content on a single subject from mixed sources, some of which may be selected manually, some automatically aggregated from different sources using manually-applied tagging and some automatically aggregated using search index or user activity data. As well as the overall experience, the paper will also focus on the in-house development of a manageable content tagging system capable of classifying content within a large body of diverse content that was simple enough for non-specialist staff to use. The presentation will include a fun practical exercise which will involve you tagging some content. This will require you to experience the actual decision-making process required of staff, who may have to use the tagging systems you may be planning, and will help you better understand the human issues involved in the case study."

This media continues to grow in our society: many museums and cultural heritage institutions are developing websites with a variety of content (videos, forums, blogs, online exhibitions, catalogues) creating a large media-centric websphere of unique value. Like any other media before, it is becoming essential to preserve this websphere of cultural and historical value. From this point of view, Web archiving is becoming a key part of today's heritage conservation. In this one-hour workshop, we will present the main aspects of web archiving: Why is it so important to collect and preserve web material? What does Web archiving mean? How to plan a web archiving project? Investment, Selection, Frequency, Quality Assurance Example of one method: the shared platform, Archivethe.net, helps institutions to easily and quickly start collecting websites including dynamic content and rich media, enabling navigation in past versions of a website, as if it was still live. Exploration of the typology of resources. A special focus will be done on videos. How to give an access on this archive?

    "url": "https://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2011/papers/situating_cultural_technologies_outdoors_desig",
    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "Mobile development and technology is the now, the here, the cutting edge. Rock art, or 'cup and ring' marks - Neolithic and Early Bronze Age carvings in stone - is the past. Here then may be the greatest contrast between the old and the new, the immutable and the ever changing. Yet it is strangely appropriate that rock art and more specifically, the interpretation of rock art, explores the potential of mobile technology. Rock art in Northumberland, in the North East of Britain, is prolific and well documented in paper and online databases but is difficult for the non-expert or casual passerby to find or even be aware of. Occasionally registered as Scheduled Ancient Monuments, rock art panels are situated in the open landscape generally without convenient museums, heritage centres or indeed buildings nearby to house information or interpretation; furthermore, placing interpretation panels next to the carvings is not often an option due to conservation and complex land-owning and managing arrangements. The untapped benefits for mobile interpretation development in this context are immense; imagine non-intrusive, on-demand content delivered to personal handsets, which users already know how to use, to discover carved panels and find out more about them. This paper discusses the Rock Art Mobile Project (RAMP), a twelve-month research project which addresses the challenge of designing and delivering mobile interpretation to three rock art areas in Northumberland. RAMP, however, moves away from the more traditional design approaches of delivering scientific content in the form of an archaeological mobile guide. It acknowledges that rock art interpretation requires a 'design space', which allows the existing archaeological content, the public's fascination with the 'cryptic' meaning of the rock art sites and the technological, social and personal situation of the user to be understood and negotiated.       Drawing on research carried out in the first stage of this project, this paper develops two lines of enquiry by: (a)  Exploring logistical challenges in relation to environmental conditions, the interoperability of mobile devices and platforms, and the long-term sustainability of solutions. The advantages of using mobile technology in such a setting are tempered by the environmental challenges, such as patchy network signal and outdoor conditions (wind, rain and bright sunlight). Couple this with the mixed range of handsets and varied visitor experience with mobile technology, and no obvious technological solution presents itself. (b)  Discussing the methods used to elicit user experience, and specifically to understand the situated nature of users' engagement with rock art in the social and wider landscape context. Three participatory design workshops were organised, with participants largely from the surrounding areas who had an interest in either rock art, archaeology, or the countryside. These workshops, (informed by the 'cultural probes' design tradition), deliberately adopted a low-tech, informal approach, to elicit specific instances or memories of recent visits to rock art and the countryside, shifting away from perceived 'truths' or generalisations about user needs. Participants were taken on a site-visit and asked to reflect on their experience using a variety of media, including booklets with sample visual content, audio on mp3 players and written prompts on wooden lollipop sticks. This paper reflects on the effectiveness of such a design approach and its ramifications for the development of mobile heritage applications which respond to the situation of their users and the constraints (and delights) of rural outdoors environments."

    "abstract": "The Art Institute of Chicago has been publishing award-winning scholarly and popular print catalogues for decades…but is this model sustainable? Digital publication appears to hold great promise for both user experience and global reach. To achieve these bright outcomes, however, institutions need to approach the challenges and opportunities of digital publication with creativity, willingness to reorganize around new ideas and the careful and adequate resourcing of this vitally important publishing agenda.  In this paper, we will share the Art Institute of Chicago's experiences gained from forging new integrated print and digital publishing workflows. The discussion will focus on case studies from our ongoing efforts on the Monet and Renoir Systematic Catalogue supported by the Getty's Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI), the Martin European Decorative Arts Gallery Interactives, the French Impressionism iPhone, iPad and Android applications, and other publications.  These projects have all required a deeper collaboration between the technology, publications, education, and marketing/ communications departments.  We will discuss our approaches to challenges brought on by these digital publishing opportunities, such as:  How do we address the impact these workflows have on both job responsibilities and available human resources?  Does increasing the digital publishing portfolio imply decreasing the number of print catalogues planned?  How can we incentivize scholars to write for digital publication?  Will certain features, such as footnotes and citation tools, allow the field of art history to better recognize the legitimacy of these digital works? What content and which publication channels are appropriate for revenue generating goals? Is new hardware like the iPad creating a new generation of expectations for digital publication?  How sustainable are these digital publications as software evolves-are we considering the ongoing maintenance costs? ?

    "abstract": "In the context of the national digitisation programme Images for the Future, The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision has designed and developed a complete technical architecture to support (mobile) location-based services for cultural heritage. This October, Sound and Vision will launch the first implementation based on this architecture in the form of an iPhone application that offers mobile access to relevant audiovisual heritage related to war monuments.   The architecture developed by Sound and Vision is based on a Drupal installation that connects to relevant open content repositories (for now: Open Images, Flickr: The Commons and Wikipedia) using their respective API's, and enables the creation of (mobile) location-based services for cultural heritage. Locations in the real world are linked to digital heritage available online. By building a location-aware application that utilizes the location information and related audiovisual heritage stored in the Drupal installation, users can access relevant information - based on their GPS location to enrich their on-site experience. The architecture also supports applications to enable users to contribute comments and images to the locations themselves. Also, it offers access through the Layar Augmented Reality browser.   To promote reuse and further development of the architecture and to ensure that other institutions can easily participate, the complete architecture is based on open source components. Because all information and relations to the online content are centrally stored, it is relatively easy to develop applications on top of the Drupal based architecture. Because the content is separated from the application, this also makes the applications very lightweight. Applications can be an iOS based application (like our first iPhone application), but with a similar effort this can also be an Android of Symbian based application. In this presentation, we will highlight the design choices and explain the business case for platforms based on open source components.  "

    "abstract": "Casgliad y Werin Cymru - The People's Collection Wales is more than just a website, it is a collaborative and federated programme developed by national institutions to tell the story of a nation from the perspective of its people. Drawing upon the memories, photographs, video, audio and 3D resources of national, regional and local archives, as well as user-generated content from groups and individuals, the website is creating a resource that places heritage media in its temporal and spatial context, and encourages  all users not just to view but to contribute and re-use this media in innovative ways. In the proposed paper, staff from the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, the National Museum Wales, the National Library of Wales, and the People's Collection Wales' Programme Manager will explain the development of this open-source system which integrates material from organisations with very different business models and data structures, and blends it through its API into a set of geo-aware digital cultural heritage resources that make sense to the end-user. The speakers will explain the federated management model under which the programme operates, a model that draws upon the strengths of all partners to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.  Speakers will make clear the moderation system that has been implemented to ensure that all material uploaded to the site is legal and can be re-used by others for educational and non-commercial purposes. The People's Collection Wales has innovation at its core - the site already operates on multiple platforms, with novel tools and apps developed to assist users to create new, and re-use existing resources; the development and application of these will be explored. The StoryBuilder tool allows users to bring together image, audio and video items from the site and repackage them, through an intuitive online movie-maker style tool, into brand new video sequences with their own metadata and spatio-temporal context. Using the TrailBuilder tool, users can create geographical trails with related media located along a route.  Each trail becomes an item in the People's Collection, to be viewed online, printed or delivered to smartphones via the free Trails Cymru app.  The Trails Cymru app itself not only enables the user to access and view trails from the People's Collection Wales system, it is also a tool for creating trails in the field.  Using the app it is possible to record a route, capture geo-located audio, video and images along this route and upload the finished trail to the People's Collection Wales website direct from the smartphone. The People's Collection Labs provides a showcase area for the most innovative developments in digital heritage presentation in Wales, and acts as a portal for developers to communicate their ideas on webGIS, augmented-reality, laser scanning, visualisation, and all that's new in online presentation of heritage media.  The latest developments arising from the People's Collection Wales' ongoing innovation programme will be explained. In addition to presenting the paper and attending the various demonstrations and sessions on offer at MW2011, the People's Collection Wales contingent hope to build upon existing relationships and establish new links with the Welsh Diaspora in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania.  If the proposed paper is accepted, we hope to organise a workshop event where those interested in the history of Wales and the Welsh in America could become contributing members of the People's Collection Wales, and act as champions for those with an interest in Wales on the other side of the Atlantic."

    "abstract": "The use of visitors' own devices for mobile programs in museums, which began with podcasts and cellphone tours some years ago, has enjoyed a renewed popularity in the age of the smartphone. A recent survey of nearly 1,600 visitors to the Smithsonian on the National Mall found that over half (52%) had an Internet-enabled phone, and 30% had a phone that could play apps. These growing numbers of powerful personal computers in the hands of museum visitors hold out the promise of reduced overheads for mobile interpretation and information services. Obviating the costs of stocking and staffing device distribution on-site, the BYOD (bring your own device) movement has also fueled hopes that the Internet-connected phone would open up new possibilities to reach off-site as well as on-site audiences, beyond the traditional audio tour business models or even the cellphone tour and podcast. Sharing this optimism, new and more specialized vendors have made it easier for museums to buy the elements of their mobile programs à la carte, mixing in-house development of both content and technology with outsourcing. In the past few years, museums have also learned that they can create their own content, as well as enlist the help of script-writers and sound designers, and publish their content to multiple platforms. So far, however, even as equipment and staffing overheads have been removed or reduced by reliance on visitors' using their own mobile devices in the museum, new cost centers and challenges have been introduced: proprietary museum-built audio players have often been replaced by equally proprietary app platforms, and the museum that wants to reach the other 70% of its on-site audience is still faced with the question of how to provide devices to visitors who don't come with - or want to use - their own phones during their museum visits. The museum that can manage a small stock of players on-site for the low take-up rates of permanent collection tours may be overwhelmed by the sudden spike in demand caused by the blockbuster exhibition. Are museums ready to take on responsibility for the mobile hardware/distribution model as well as content and software? This paper draws on recent case studies at SFMOMA, MoMA, Balboa Park, the Smithsonian and learnings from other mobile projects around the world to consider museums' options in response to these challenges and the new business models that are emerging for mobile platforms: 1.     Digital retail (app/download sales) 2.     Freemium (e.g. in-app sales) 3.     Donations (e.g. by text message) 4.     Subscription content (e.g. iPad catalogues, magazines) 5.     Sponsorship and ad-supported content 6.     Monetizing data from mobile social media 7.     Providing devices for blockbusters in the BYOD economy 8.     Using mobile to support membership and other revenue channels The authors will discuss the macro and micro impact of mobile technology on museum business today; the economics, including costs, financing, benefits, return on investment, and opportunity costs; and the risks of being both on and under the mobile 2.0 bus."

    "abstract": "William Paterson University has undergone an expensive, lengthy web branding campaign in 2010 that has unified the online presence for the college. Overall university templates drive the design of every website on campus. While this may be appropriate for the vast majority of college departments and groups, it has remained important for the University Galleries, Art Department galleries and cultural art spaces to differentiate themselves online. Through a series of design phases and hard-fought compromises I have been able to give each of the online galleries their own unique design, while still complying with the overall University branding campaign. In this demonstration I will present each stage of the design process, from the original university branding to the more unique web presence implemented at the end of the process. By sharing the University Gallery website (http://www.wpunj.edu/coac/gallery/), the Center for Chinese Art website (http://wpunj.edu/ccart/) and the Art Department website (http://www.wpunj.edu/coac/departments/art/student.dot, http://www.wpunj.edu/coac/departments/art/student.dot) and its evolution throughout the process I will demonstrate how online galleries can differentiate themselves within an overarching design scheme while still complying with university branding goals."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "Summary Crowdsourcing data through games is an attractive proposition for museums looking to maximise use of their collections online without the requirement to commit intensive curatorial resources to enhancing catalogue records.  This paper investigates the optimum game designs to encourage participation and the generation of useful data. Further detail Projects such as Armchair Revolutionary[1], Carnegie Mellon University's 'Games with a purpose'[2] and InterroBang?![3] are indicative of the trend for 'games for social good'. Crowdsourced projects such as the Guardian newspapers examination of MPs expense claims[4], the V&A Museum's image cropping[5], Brooklyn Museum's tagging game[6], the National Library of Australia's collaborative OCR corrections[7]; Chen's study of the application of Csikszentmihalyi's theory of 'flow' to game design; and McGonigal's ideas about multiplayer games as 'happiness engines'[8] all suggest that 'playful interactions' and crowd participation could be applied to help create specific content improvements on museum sites. Game mechanisms may help make tasks that would not traditionally be considered fun or relaxing into a compelling experience. Games designed to crowdsource museum metadata are particularly interesting when limited resources within museums make it difficult to enhance and publish large bodies of collections data in ways that are accessible to non-specialist visitors.  Further, museum metadata games are a form of collections access in their own right and have the potential to reach large, traditionally hard-to-reach audiences.  Data generated may include terms to improve discoverability by adding alternate terms used by the general public (as in the steve.museum project); information about which objects are more interesting for different types of visitors; data that could be provided by curators and researchers if resources were unlimited but could also be solicited from specialists outside the museum; and experiential data for objects and events within living memory. Based on a Masters Dissertation project ('Game mechanics for social good: a case study on interaction models for crowdsourcing museum collections enhancement', http://openobjects.blogspot.com/2010/06/game-mechanics-for-social-good-case.html, due January 2011) this paper will cover three topics: research summary of emerging best practice about games designed to crowdsource metadata analysis of the most effective elements of game mechanics for application to interfaces for crowdsourcing museum collections enhancement, based on the evaluation of games designed as part of the project and the evaluation of data produced as the games are played. an emerging typology of game designs applicable for different models of collection data, based on categories such as breadth of collection data (from selected hero objects to the entire catalogue), the type of metadata desired, the level of specialist knowledge required to  interpret objects, etc. Games built with collections from museums of social history and history of science and technology will be available at http://museumgam.es/ from mid-October.

    "abstract": "This discussion will focus on the new roles of interns as museums respond to radical changes, many of which have technological underpinnings, and job positions and career opportunities expand in cultural technology--the emerging field at the intersection of digital media, networks, and cultural content. Cultural repositories are at a critical transition point. The Web is having a profound impact on how institutions fulfill their cultural missions. An increasing share of resources--human and financial--are devoted to digitization, preservation, and online access. Some of the questions we will address are as follows: How is technology driving changes in the traditionsl roles of museum interns and mentors? How can museum internship programs empower students from diverse backgrounds to become cultural intrepreters and knowledge contributers? What are some strategies for funding internship partnerships between museums and universities? How can interns help museums adapt to technological change? In June 2010 the Cultural Technology Partnership of the New Mexico Dept. of Cultural Affairs and New Mexico Highlands University Media Arts received funding to establish the first AmeriCorps Cultural Technology Internship Program. If this presentation is accepted we will bring two of our AmeriCorps volunteers to share their experiences and enliven discussion."

Designing intuitive systems that meet researcher's needs requires a thorough understanding of the information seeking behaviour of collection database users. A proper understanding of how museum visitors use digital museum resources is critical for the success of museums in the information age. As museums cope with the challenges of ‘being digital' (Hamma 2004), meeting the information requirements of online visitors has become an important part of the museum's role (Marty 2004) and it is now critical for researchers and museum professionals to explore the use of museum digital resources, both in-house and online (Booth 1998; Sarraf 1999). The British Museum shows continuing commitment to providing as wide virtual and physical access to their collections as possible, utilising different mediums to open up the museum collections to a wider, more diverse audience. This commitment is expressed in the British Museum's online collection database. In October 2007, the British Museum launched Collection Online (COL), an online version of the collection database. By the end of 2009, nearly 2 million records from the museum collections had been made available to the public worldwide. Despite the online availability of the British Museum Collection, very little is known about the COL's users and whether and how they utilise the material provided, or if the online collection makes possible new kinds of engagement with museum objects.

    "abstract": "With mobile augmented-reality technologies and applications, museums can extend their relationship with visitors beyond physical boundaries to engage them further in discovery-based learning. Using freely available mobile augmented-reality (AR) authoring platforms and publishing tools, the Exploratorium is experimenting with extensions to both its physical and web exhibit spaces to allow visitors to interact with exhibits and natural phenomenon around the San Francisco Bay Area.  Applications developed with two platforms, Layar and Junaio, allow mobile users with AR-capable smart phones (equipped with a camera and GPS) to explore their surroundings through live camera views of these devices and to interact with overlaid multilayered, geo-referenced information. Interactive content \"layers\" let visitors with compatible devices, including iPhone and Android smartphones, see annotated information about physical exhibits and locations in outdoor spaces, leave \"markers,\"of their visit experience in places where others can see them, and explore temporal data about objects and locations. While it's possible to get started right away developing content and user-experiences with mobile AR, advances in mobile image processing, tagging technologies, and wearable computing-combined with the convergence of distributed networks and location-aware applications-will help define more intimate modes of human-computer interaction that museum exhibit and experience developers can further explore. This paper discusses content creation for mobile AR experience design using these two platforms, strategies for incorporating preparation of mobile AR-ready information into a digital content creation workflow, and measuring impact via mobile analytics. It covers key processes including  geotagging  different types of assets (images, videos, audio, and 3-D objects) and methods of interfacing the AR authoring platforms with content in external systems including event calendars, media portal/content management systems, and social-sharing sites such as YouTube, and Flickr.  "

    "abstract": "In a digitalised and globalised world, what are the challenges the museum faces when users increasingly experience knowledge as something created through blogs, wikis and other social platforms? In which the museum collections no longer hold the absolute truth, but rather layers of collected knowledge to be interpreted and augmented through interpretation and adaptation by guests and other voices? This workshop will look at some of the practical, epistemological and technical approaches to the challenges based on specific case material. In April 2010 the Museum of Copenhagen, in cooperation with Gibson Group Ltd and Spild af Tid/Waste of Time, launched a giant multi-touch multimedia installation in one of the central squares in Copenhagen. In the first half year of its 14 hour a day functioning, The WALL, as it is called, has attracted more than 400,000 users, who have viewed more than 2,000,000 images, sent more than 60,000 personal postcards, and maybe most importantly, uploaded 2,500 new contributions of their own. Semi-mobile, The WALL will be moved around Copenhagen over the coming four years. It gives Copenhageners street access to a poetic cityscape of images and knowledge about their city, and offers a platform for all citizens and guests of the city to interact with and discuss the past, present and future of the city. In parallel to the multi-touch installation experienced in the streets, a website connects The WALL, its multimedia database and the museum. Both the website and The WALL support the museum's new profile of having the city as its prime object and being fully embedded in the city. See a 5 minute documentary on the project: http://tinyurl.com/24h65ya The workshop will allow participants to get inside the project and discuss the challenges and lessons of this pioneering work, while exploring hands-on the unique user interface on a cut-down version of The WALL - including a year's worth of user contributions. In this way the workshop will investigate: practical and technical challenges concerning the development of a mobile, multi-touch, user-involving installation, outdoors in the city space hands-on use of the \"2D/3D cityscape editor\" software that creates the cultural topographies of The WALL the conceptual and epistemological considerations and choices underlying these topographies achievements and lessons from the first year of operation - how do reception, use and interaction correspond with the original intentions we had in the development phase, what are the differences and how can they be explained? Are there things we would have done differently? Does the Wall create a new agenda for future museum practices and for the relationship between cities, citizens and their museums? Participants are invited to present examples of their own experiences with multi-user and user-generated content installations, and to reflect on their experiences with operating these in a non-regulated milieu."

    "abstract": "In 2008 SMK National Gallery of Denmark initiated a 5 year digital strategy. A core initiative is Art Stories: an innovative online resource that offers exciting stories and background material about artworks, artists and how they connect. The ambition is to retell the story of art and make it come alive on the web, exploiting the possibilities offered by digital media. The Gordian knot we have tried to cut is: How do we develop an innovative digital art experience based on a chaotic, 'rhizomatic' structural principle, and at the same time keep it intuitively navigable and user-friendly? Art Stories is a research-based resource founded on the principle of serendipity. Layers of information are hidden in the images, and content can be entered from many different angles. Art Stories is intentionally in the plural and its stories are told by many - often opposing - voices within the art world. Lesser known artists and artworks are shown side by side with more familiar material in order to challenge the traditional notion of a canonized body of 'highlights'. The idea is to present art history as a 'rhizome' - a non-hierarchical network of connections crossing traditional art historical categories - echoing the structure of www. We deliberately eschew a linear structure, hoping users will get lost in the content (in a positive, 'serendipitic' sense).  Users create their own tracks through the web of interrelated artists and artworks, and these tracks can inspire other users to find their way through Art Stories. Instead of perceiving SMK's collections as a 'walled garden', the resource is based on syndication and links from SMK to related artworks and content in museums and institutions all over the world. Art Stories targets adult users with an initial interest in art. User surveys show that they demand more online content that deepens visits to SMK, as well as offering digital art experiences in their own right. During the development of Art Stories we have conducted 5 different user-tests of concept and prototype. Taking into account recent development within the field of art history, it was key for us to create a rhizomatic interface. But several times we faced the dilemma: Users explicitly advised us to adjust the interface to their common expectations and habits. At the same time, we felt strongly about carrying out our original vision. Consequently, we needed to explore how we could make 'navigating the rhizome' user-friendly.  Did we achieve this? Only time can tell. Art Stories version 1.0 launches in November 2010, containing more than 700 individual artworks and 500 written pages. Post-launch more content will be added to the ever-expanding stories. Our paper will draw on results from pre-launch tests and focus on the process of developing the concept and design in dialogue with users - but also sometimes against their immediate wishes and expectations. At the time of MW2011, we have been online for 5 months and will present results from new user-tests and surveys that reflect the actual reception and use of Art Stories."

    "abstract": "In this presentation, we introduce factors that help shape a model predicting individuals' engagement in outreach activities and the extent to which web-based tools support those outreach activities. The NASA Night Sky Network (NSN) may serve as an example for the museum community to create an online hub for exhibits and programs, as well as help museum workers understand individuals' motivation for outreach, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful recruitment and retention of volunteers.   The NASA Night Sky Network is a nationwide community supporting over 350 amateur astronomy clubs who conduct educational outreach across the U.S.A. at museums, science centers, parks, and on urban sidewalks.   An example of how NSN clubs help museums is when the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers, a NSN club, set up telescopes outside of the museum for hundreds of visitors to view the moon and planets, enhancing the De Young Museum's public program called Van Gogh's Starry Night Over the Bay.    One NSN objective is to serve the clubs' outreach needs by providing web-based tools to reduce clubs' efforts in publicizing outreach activities. This presentation introduces findings from research conducted by the Institute for Learning Innovation (ILI) in partnership with the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) on clubs' use of NSN website and services, and potential factors that motivate club members to actively engage in outreach.  Telephone interviews with a dozen astronomy club leaders throughout the country in both mid-2010 and late 2010 indicated specific ways in which NSN tools such as a web-based interactive calendar, iPhone application, and widget were being accepted and utilized.   While research is still ongoing, an intended outcome is to introduce factors that help shape a comprehensive model predicting individuals' engagement in outreach activities and the extent to which web-based tools support those outreach activities. Additionally, NSN may serve as an example for the museum community to create online hubs for exhibits and programs.                "

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "Laura Robert's landmark book \"From Knowledge to Narrative\" (Roberts, 1997) analyzed a paradigm shift in museum exhibition in the late 20th century as educators moved museums from traditional methods of knowledge transmission to constructivist interpretive methods such as narrative. Today, museum educators wishing to adopt game-based learning methods face a similar challenge: to move from now-familiar narrative methods to a systems-based approach. Games are, at heart, a set of rules that define player choices and subsequent consequences. Applying a strong narrative to a game usually results in neither a good story nor a good game. Instead, we must learn to think like game and system designers, finding the rules intrinsic to our content.    In some ways, this shift from narrative to systems is less formidable than was the shift from knowledge transmission, since both narrative and systems are rooted in constructivism, the notion that learning is, as Hein (1998) says, \"is not a simple addition of items into some sort of mental data bank but a transformation of schemas in which the learner plays an active role and which involves making sense out of a range of phenomena.\" Games, one could argue, are even more constructivist than narratives, since the player's role is by definition active, evaluating various phenomena to inform successful tactics to win the game.    Nevertheless, this shift from narrative to systems is often difficult for museum educators, particularly art and history educators schooled in the humanities rather than science. Exhibits and education materials generally explore the idiosyncrancies of a given topic, whether they be the expressive and interpretive aspects of an artwork or the narrative arc of an historical event. The meaning to be made from this approach is powerful, often pulling us back in even when we struggle toward a systems approach. For example, inspired by game designer Sid Meier's fabled definition of a good game as \"a series of interesting choices,\" we might use a \"choose your own adventure\" branching story design. This approach appears to serve both the idiosyncratic arc of an historical narrative while providing the meaningful choices so central to a game. In practice, though, this approach serves both the history and the gameplay poorly, as it forces players into increasingly less-meaningful choices simply to keep the number of story branches manageable.    Instead, we must adopt a true rules-based design, digging into our content to find even a few rules inherent in the subject matter that can then define the gameplay. This paper will explore this challenge, drawing on both game design theory (core dynamics, rules, actions, skills, chance) and published commercial and non-profit games to show how the heterogeneous realworld content of museums can indeed be turned into exciting and meaningful learning games.   References: Hein, G.

    "abstract": "Proposal for paper Museums and the Web 2011  Authors: Margriet Schavemaker (Stedelijk Museum) en Hein Wils (Stedelijk Museum), Paul Stork en Ebelien Pondaag (Fabrique)  In 2009 Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam started the project ARtours. This project aims at investigating and producing augmented reality tours around the collection of the Stedelijk and modern art in general. The project aims at both indoor and outdoor applications: -          Indoor as a replacement or addition to the classic audio tour. -          Outdoor as a new experience and new interactions with modern art   In both instances not only the current collection is used but also new developed art forms and new narratives will be incorporated in the project. The paper will describe the project in all its aspects. Ranging from AR technologies and AR mobile browsers to storytelling and enhancing the user experience inside and outside the museum. The two year project is halfway. Several pilots and its conclusions from this first period will be described. One of the pilots is 'Ik op het museumplein' (myself on the museum square). Virtual three dimensional art is presented on specific locations and accessible through the augmented reality browser Layar. Outside on de museum square in Amsterdam people with an Iphone or Adroid smart phone with Layar can walk around and engage with virtual art (virtual 3D objects and sound). Another pilot is a virtual art library. Again with the use of Layar users can borrow art objects from the museum and place these objects in de space around them. This pilot was conducted during the Lowlands music festival in the summer. A third pilot is the design tour. In an walk through the city of Amsterdam users can experience (interior, product, graphic) design in it's context. Users can walk from one virtual object to another and learn more about the object and the place it is linked to. The project focuses on a wide range of aspects such as technical, user experience, creation and management of information, indoor and outdoor, young and older audiences.    "

    "abstract": "Novice museum visitors often lack the skills for interpreting and engaging with works of art on display. We have observed visitors glossing through exhibits lacking the capacity to make meaning from art viewing. A social mobile application that we have created and tested helps novice visitors to actively engage with works of art, develop their vocabulary, and enhance their art-viewing skills. Supporting novice users in building art-viewing capacity is essential for making a lasting impact on visitors and encouraging life-long learning in the arts.   This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of Art-e-Muse, a social mobile application that helps novice viewers develop the skills needed to actively engage with works of art. Art-e-Muse has been developed and tested in the Davis Museum and Cultural Center, an academic fine-arts museum on the Wellesley College campus. Through the deployment of Art-e-Muse we investigate how the use of mobile human-computer interaction paired with social networking can offer advantages for museums seeking to redefine the museum experience for novice visitors.   Art-e-Muse was designed using a participatory design methodology and is implemented as an iPod Touch and iPhone application utilizing the Facebook Connect API. During the period of May through July 2010, we conducted a series of workshops with museum staff, students, and faculty. As a result, we set three goals for Art-e-Muse: 1) fostering engagement with works of art, 2) promoting dialogue about art between members of a community, and 3) encouraging repeat visits to the museum. To accomplish these goals, Art-e-Muse diverges from the traditional museum guide approach in which experts provide information for visitors to consume. Interaction with Art-e-Muse is initiated when visitors use the device camera to scan a two-dimensional code placed next to a work of art. Art-e-Muse then presents users with a series of prompts that serve to create an interactive and reflective experience. Prompts are short and specific for each work of art. Prompts may include questions that encourage deep looking, anecdotal facts, and brief exercises requiring users to consider narrative, style, artists' intent, and technique. A game mechanic rewards users with coins from the museum collection when certain milestones are accomplished. To create a sense of social presence and foster a dialogue, the application allows users to share insights, responses and accomplishments with their friends on Facebook.  The game mechanic leads to deep engagement and encourages users to make return visits to the museum.   The system was preliminary evaluated during August 2010. Findings indicate that novice users were engaged with works of arts, spending a significant amount of time with each work. Users were eager to use Art-e-Muse and expressed their satisfaction learning new ways to think of works of art both from the prompts and from others' responses. Following this evaluation, we deployed Art-e-Muse in a permanent collection gallery and are currently evaluating its use. Our methodology includes direct observation, data collection through system logging, surveys, and in-depth interviews. This paper will describe the design, technical development, and results from the evaluation of Art-e-Muse. "

    "abstract": "At the start of 2011, Australia's Museum Victoria, published a Field Guide for Victorian Animals for iOS devices: iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. The app currently contains information for approximately 650 Victorian animal species, including birds, mammals, snakes, lizards and frogs, as well as butterflies, snails, spiders and other invertebrates. Museum Victoria (MV) has released source code for the app under an open source license. This demo will show how any institution can use that code and their own data, images and audio to customize and publish a field guide for their local area on iOS devices. For a number of years now, museums have been investigating and trialing how to deliver content using mobile devices. Over the past year, there has been an increasing number of applications released that support onsite tours, an extension into the mobile domain of traditional single-purpose audio tour guides. This work has been accompanied by the development of  standards and schemas to support tours, e.g. TourML. This type of tour application has often been developed by art galleries and museums and is useful within the walls of a museum. For natural history museums, mobile applications can also make the most of the wealth of its information that is valuable outside its four walls. Traditionally published in book form, field guides contain information about animals or plants, including physical descriptions, biology, reproduction, ecology and distribution. They are usually rich with images, as images are the best method of identification. The MV field guide uses data written by MV's science curators, images and sounds exported from Museum Victoria's collection management system. Image and sound files sourced from Museum Victoria or external photographers and sound recordists.  "

    "abstract": "As museums continue to develop more sophisticated techniques for managing and analyzing cultural data, many are beginning to encounter challenges when trying to deal with the nuances of language and automated processing tools.  How might user-generated comments be harvested and processed to determine the nature of the comment?  Is it possible to use existing collection documentation to derive relations between similar objects?  How can we train systems to automatically recognize (disambiguate) different meanings of the same word? Can automated language processing lead to more compelling browsing interfaces for online collections? Luckily, a good deal of expertise and tools exist within the field of computational linguistics that can be applied to these problems to achieve meaningful results.  Informed by previous work in computational linguistics and relevant project experience, the authors will address a number of these questions providing insight about how answers to impact museum practice might be found. Authors will share tools and resources that museum software developers can use to prototype and experiment with these techniques - without being experts in language processing themselves.  In addition, the authors will describe the work of the T3: Text, Tags, Trust research project and how they have applied these tools to a large shared dataset of object metadata and social tags collected by the Steve.museum project.  Specific challenges regarding batch-processing tools and large datasets will be addressed.  Best practices and algorithms will be shared for dealing with a number of sticky issues. Directions for future research and promising application areas will be also be discussed."

    "abstract": "The recent explosion of options used by museums to produce mobile experiences is undeniable.  In the last 18 months, dozens of new mobile platforms have entered the marketplace as museums are planning, producing, and launching new experiences for visitors on their mobile devices. Besides launching a successful tour, how can museum professionals ensure that the content we create will outlive the technology and vendors we select today? A successful metadata standard for mobile tours would provide a number of advantages for museums. A mobile standard will allow museums to migrate the content and structure of a tour between the variety of tools available today and tools that may be available in the future. Similarly, a mobile standard would allow the same tour to be used on a number of current and future mobile devices. In addition, museums could choose authoring tools which best fit their staff and workflow needs while still deploying to whatever mobile device is best for their content - even if these tools are provided by different vendors. Perhaps most importantly, a successful mobile standard would ensure that museum content will outlive any particular technology we use today. The TourML (t."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "The UK Parliament is based in the world-famous Palace of Westminster in London. However, a historic building filled with art and politicians creates a perception of politics amongst many school-aged students that is a total turn-off. So how do you overcome these barriers to engage young people in the work of Parliament and arm them with the skills and knowledge to become active citizens? Parliament's Education Service turned to online gaming for the solution. MP For A Week is an award-winning, multi-level online game that places the player directly in the shoes of a Member of Parliament, experiencing first-hand the personal and professional dilemmas of a week in politics, taking responsibility for their decisions, and then seeing the implications on their careers. The drama is presented in an ever-changing environment, offering a diverse blend of strategy and experimentation, together with a high level of personalisation. A positive overall rating is the ultimate purpose of the game - just like in real life. One of our key aims was to present a uniquely credible and intriguing view of the political process, whilst taking on the challenges of making the subject matter interesting and accessible. Finding the right 'hooks' to engage the target audience was critical, as well as understanding the relationship between young people's perceptions of the impressive building and the challenge of engaging them in the work that goes on inside. The grandeur of the Palace, its history and its collections create a sense of awe amongst young people that can form a barrier to their engagement with its modern-day functions. We wanted to break these barriers and capitalise on the building to increase engagement. One way we achieved this was to inject a real sense of drama in the game with exclusive photography coupled with 3D illustrations placing the player directly in the 'corridors of power' whilst having to carry out the day-to-day work of an elected politician. MP For A Week was an ambitious undertaking. Behind the scenes lies a powerful game engine, a year's worth of work and a massive collaboration between students, teachers, MPs and games developers. In our demonstration we will show how technology, politics, gaming and learning came together to create the resource, which won the UK E-Learning Award 2010 for 'Best Learning Game'. We will share tips and our own learning in developing engaging and successful educational games within a heritage setting. And we will share our vision for phase two of MP For A Week, and reveal plans for our next major online project: a unique society-building adventure."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "If the future is mobile, how is the museum community experiencing that future, what are their ambitions within it, and in which areas is further knowledge share required?  It was specifically to gain an insight into questions such as these that the 2010 International Museums and Mobile survey was developed.  This paper will present and analyse the responses of the 600+ museum professionals that participated in this research. The 2010 International Museums and Mobile Survey reached out to museum professionals internationally to share their perspectives and understanding of mobile interpretation at their institutions.  Dividing respondents into four categories - those from institutions that already used mobile interpretation, those from institutions that were planning to use mobile interpretation tools, those from institutions that had no plans to use mobile interpretation tools, and those from vendors working in this field - the survey sought to gain an insight into the everyday realities of developing, delivering and sustaining mobile interpretation provisions in an institution.  The survey questions related to the objectives of, and target audience for, an institution's mobile interpretation experience; the challenges faced by institutions in planning and operating a mobile interpretation experience; and what strategies were used to measure the success of these experiences.  Other questions probed the aspects of mobile interpretation in which individuals felt there were insufficient knowledge share, and also about what excited them most in this field. Over 600 museum professionals responded to the survey, sharing their views on the above questions. Responses were received from individuals working in institutions with a wide variety of backgrounds and profiles: institutions in over twenty countries are represented in the results; two thirds of all responses were from institutions that did not use mobile interpretation tools, and of which half were planning to in the twelve months, and half had no such plans.  Whilst a quarter of responses came from within institutions that boast an annual attendance upwards of 250,000 visitors, more than half had annual attendance of under 50,000 visitors (and less than 1 staff member working in digital media). Drawing on this data source, this Paper will draw out the key trends that arise, and forward analysis on their context and implications for the community.  It will explore opinions on issues ranging from whether mobile interpretation should be available at an additional cost to visitors, to how to define the target audience for a mobile interpretation tool (i.e. is it just \"those that like audio guides\"?).  And from whether in five years time museums will still be required to provide a hardware platform to visitors for the mobile experience, to the obstacles those entering the field are facing today.  Through this analysis, this paper aims to provide guidance to those museums entering this field for the first time, create awareness of those areas where further knowledge share is required (and hopefully identify those institutions best placed to provide such knowledge), and ultimately provide a valuable tool on which to further inform debates in this field."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "Most modern-day museums use their existing physical collection and the events they stage as a starting point for online activities. Communities are built around (parts of) the collection or specific offline events of a museum. Literature such as Museum and the Web papers, describes numerous case studies of successful projects. This paper examines the case of the National Vending Machine of the Museum of National History of the Netherlands. The National Vending Machine is an ongoing project focusing on everyday objects and their historical and personal significance. Its objective is to build a 'community of objects' that shows which historical objects are relevant to our audience. Visitor contributions are central to building this community of objects. Through it we gain an understanding of how to engage people with history, culture and the museum. After two instalments of the National Vending Machine at different locations and a number of related activities, a foundation for the community of objects has been established and a number of lessons have been learned about using communities to build a collection. The project consists of a website and a redesigned traditional Dutch vending machine. Online and offline are linked by RFID technology. The curatorial staff of the museum chose about 100 everyday objects as a starting point for the collection. These were tested with a general audience, and 37 objects were selected to figure in the first instalment. Visitors could discover and buy the objects offline, and add their personal stories online. They were also encouraged to add their own ideas and stories online in order to help expand the community of objects. Although the project received positive feedback from nearly all visitors, only a handful of ideas and stories had been added after a three-month trial period. Interviews with visitors proved the project could be successful, provided some changes were made. A two-day try-out of an improved interaction model followed, focusing more on personal stories. This led to a redesign of the website. Visitors and their stories were featured whereas the objects and the project were made less prominent. These improvements significantly fostered higher participation in the second instalment of the National Vending Machine. This paper discusses the five main lessons learned with regard to putting a community at the core of creating an online collection: 1) A focus on the existing collection limits the freedom of visitors to contribute their ideas and stories, whereas 2) a focus on visitors and their stories increases participation and encourages the creation of a varied collection. 3) Offline encouragement is key to creating healthy online engagement. 4) Immediate rewards, physical or virtual, are a strong trigger for participation. 5) The design of both the offline and online environment should be centred on the participant. The case of the National Vending Machine shows that it is possible, albeit difficult, to make a community the heart of a collection, thus reversing the traditional museum collection model. We believe these conclusions and recommendations to be of substantial value to museums that are planning crowd-sourced expositions or are looking for ways to increase participation with their online collections."

    "abstract": "People have always wanted to tell stories about their experiences and to connect to shared meaning and values. The advent of social media enforces this even more. At the same time our mobile phones are steadily turning into digital Swiss Army Knives full of informative, creative and social potential. To make sure the development of new tools and systems is \"culture smart\" and to explore how \"mobile ready\" cultural audiences are the Amsterdam Historical Museum (AHM), media lab Waag Society and cultural funder DOEN develop in close collaboration the Amsterdam Museum App. Strengthening a visitor's sense of place and context (the outside world, the city) to the museum experience - and therefore, connecting a living society with our formal heritage - means exploring the social dimensions of formal and informal heritage sites and creating new ways of engaging with an audience. The Amsterdam Museum App is a first step in creating a GPS based, location aware heritage platform, in which museums can create their own multimedia city tours and location based games, that does just this: connecting history and current events to locations in the city in an interactive and fun way, allowing the users to be the curator of their own experience. Publishing their own images, comments or suggestions related to the tour to other audiences on other (social) platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. The core technology is a proven technical backbone (7scenes.com) publishing location based content to iPhone and Android devices, which is developed further in close collaboration with the project partners. The development of the Museum App in so called 'Locative Labs' - a short, repetitive, interdisciplinary and intense collaboration, think 2 days per week, for 6 weeks - is a unique meeting of curators, media professionals, concept developers and technical colleagues in the AHM and Waag Society. The joint development is based on experiment: rapid prototyping and testing of city tours; and on the spot content development. The Lab setting is one of the methods used by Waag Society to do creative research: explore interaction principles and demo innovative solutions in a real setting, with real stakeholders and real users. AHM will be the launching customer of the Museum App, after which the platform will be open to all cultural organizations. The Amsterdam Museum App will feature four interactive routes exploring the fundamental aspects of the city of Amsterdam, the creative, the entrepreneurial, the tolerant and the civic agency; connecting the outside experience closely to the narrative of the new permanent indoor exhibition Amsterdam in Close up (opening, may 2011). In the Labs the partners explore novel social media practices as a new way to engage audiences with heritage. Connecting it to personal accounts and social network communities might help in getting (more / new / different) audiences meaningfully involved."

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "Most digitised and online available objects from GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) can be browsed through a predefined set of formal metadata, such as its creator, year of creation, and type of material. Standards for metadata management and exchange have matured and are being adopted widely. They enable intra-collection search and exploration, and are also main drivers behind supporting domain and cross-boundary access to collections. However, these formal metadata often do not give access to information pertaining to the content of the object, such as its topic, or what is depicted. This information is often given through textual descriptions which are mostly only accessible through keyword search. Keyword search is limited in the sense that it does not facilitate sorting, or retrieving objects whose descriptions contain terms that are synonymous to the search term. This paper provides results of an interdisciplinary research project, Agora, that is taking collection access one step further by enabling users to search and browse museum collections through the content descriptions of objects in a structured way. The three-year Agora project is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and brings together computer scientists, cultural heritage experts, and humanities researchers. We present advances in collection access through automatic data enrichment and linking to thesauri and external resources using a combination of state of the art information extraction and semantic web technology. In this work, we show results on enrichment, linking and integration of two collections, namely those of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV) and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (RMA). Our first contribution to the state of the art in collection access enables users to browse and search descriptive metadata elements in a structured manner; our focus here is on automatically linking objects to historical events, thus providing users of the collection with objects in context. The figure shows a screenshot of an object from the NISV collection, along with its automatically enriched description field. The entities and events that are identified in the description field, are linked to instances in the event thesaurus. The instances in the event thesaurus are multifaceted objects that are modelled through an event model, providing the historical context to an object. This new dimension that is added to the collection information has profound implications regarding visualisation; a list or facet view does not do justice to the richness events provide. Our second contribution is a presentation method of enriched collection objects through an interface that is based on the same event model that also underlies the event thesaurus. This interface explicitly shows the event links that connect collection objects and support user interactions that are subsequently used to enrich the knowledge of the collections. The first evaluations of our approach indicate that event-driven collection access offers users a more meaningful and richer experience. As information extraction and semantic web technologies are advancing at a rapid pace, we foresee that event-driven access as proposed by Agora will be adopted widely in the cultural heritage domain in the near future."

    "abstract": "In recognizing its societal role as a research university and in facing an (inter)national  decline in science students, the University of Groningen developed a successful outreach program to attract teenagers to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), even doubling its student numbers in STEM. Science LinX, the science center of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, plays a pivotal role, linking formal to informal learning. The major task of Science LinX is to inspire hard to get teenagers with often hard to communicate cutting-edge science. In our strategy we've experienced the usefulness of the BètaMentality Model, which maps the attitudes towards science and technology of teenagers and distinguishes four basic groups (High Techs, Career Techs, Curious Generalists and Non Techs). Combined with the learning theory of Kolb and Brainstyles Model, it gives us a grip in linking our physical and virtual activities in tailor made programs to the specific needs of each group. Science LinX offers science activities, exhibits, expos, serous games, demonstrations, workshops, debates, speed dates with role models, science café's and competitions, constantly combining the virtual with the physical. Science centre and website are set up simultaneously and in accordance with one another. To connect to the RL (Real Life) and SL (Screen Life) of teenagers, we've blurred the walls of our science centre even further, by participating with an Arts & Science pavilion at the yearly Performing Arts Festival in the city. Like other science centres and musea we aim at the most effective mix of media and blended learning, generating a better image of science and technology towards teenagers. Often referred to as the Net-generation or Generation-Z: with preference for tweets and sound bites, low attention span, but also 2nd nature talent for problem solving and collaborating, seemingly controlling the world at their fingertips. We deliver them different types of unexpected and exciting user-experiences, and challenge them to hang out, mess around en geek out with science in the different informal learning spaces of Science LinX, according to the categories of the Digital Youth Project. In our newest AR (Augmented Reality) exhibit, virtual researchers of our faculty hang out with teenagers who play the AR game. Meeting scientists in new ways like this, telling the stories of science in short text message formats, without loosing the scientific value, are new and Xperimental ways for Science LinX to investigate the new possible ways of bringing the hard to communicate scientific subjects like nano-technology, closer to the daily lives of our visitors. We'll present a number of these examples, directly connected to the varying types of teenagers.  "

    "abstract": "The project \"Audience+, Museums and the Participative Web\" investigates the challenges and opportunities for Swiss cultural heritage institutions with regards to the use of digital social media. It is supported by the Organisation of Swiss museums and aims at developing best practice guidelines for Swiss museums. The project, running from spring 2010 until spring 2011, is unique in its kind, at least in the German speaking countries of Europe. Audience+ does not only involve a quantitative survey amongst Swiss museums but also a series of five workshops with a group of seven representative institutions. During those workshops various aspects surrounding the use of social media were discussed as well as examined through various hands-on briefs. Cultural heritage institutions in Switzerland are just now waking up to the possibilities of social media but a certain insecurity and reluctance still prevails. We found that what prevents many museums from a more sophisticated usage of Facebook, blogs and other tools is not only the lack of resources and know how. As important is the question of how to fit social media into the existing strategies and into the institutional culture. We soon realised that institutional settings and hierarchies do often challenge the use of social media. In this context, not only vertical hierarchies can be an obstacle. Horizontal relationships specific to museums, such as the traditional separation between education, marketing and curation/collection do have a similarly strong influence on how social media are considered and used. Traditional beliefs about the role of conservation and research in a museum context also seem to be in conflict with ideas of stronger audience participation through new technologies. Whilst some of these aspects are specific to Switzerland, many findings are transferable to institutions all over the world. The medium-term aim of Audience+ is to support Swiss museums in making informed decisions about the usage of social media. Accordingly the guidelines we are currently developing will be more than a museum marketing manual. We are taking a holistic approach by trying to help the institutions and individual employees to understand how their institution or their particular field of expertise can gain through the use of social media. The guidelines will also explain what kind of institutional setting is needed in order to support social media. We will then discuss how the acceptance towards social media can be raised and we will give advice on how to integrate social media with existing strategies. How-to manuals and links to best-practice case studies will further support the guidelines. In line with our topic we are also planning to open up the process of writing the guideline to our community of arts managers and museums."

A possible use for mobile guides in the museum context is for navigation among the exhibits (e.g. a tour); While navigation for individuals visiting a museum has been studied extensively, the study of individuals and groups navigating in museums with electronic mobile guides is in its nascent stages; The PIL museum system, which provides via an indoor positioning system , a set of location context sensitive presentations; is amended with a set of pre-planned tours; For the sake of our study the tours are tailored to one of the different visitor types proposed by Falk (Explorer, Experience Seeker, Professional/Hobbyist, Recharger, and Facilitator)[Falk2009]; The characteristics of the user type are taken into consideration in designing the different tour routes and which presentations are given preference; thereby providing us with an adaptive system. An important design point of this adaptation is that it does not eliminate user choices but rather orders them based on the stereotypical user model. Navigation aids are provided based both on maps of the museum and direction giving enhanced by landmarks. The issues involved with providing navigation aids of both types are analyzed and discussed. The planned degrees of freedom, that is the number of choices of paths in the tour, is also correlated to the Falk types. In order to involve a group in the decision making process of navigation we use a mobile device equipped with a small projector in order to provide a shared space.  A sample demonstation of the prototype ammended guide will be presented [Falk2009] Falk, J.

Examples include gallery interactives that share content with the museum?s Web presence, delivery of video in various formats, and using APIs to harvest data in the gallery interactives.By using Web technologies, we are tapping into our own learned experiences of delivering for the Web whilst also making the most of a larger technical community. What we see in our galleries translates very well to the Web, and with some simple lessons learned and an Internet connection, there is no reason we can?t share our gallery experience with our on-line version, or vice versa.This workshop looks at the process of understanding what it takes to commission interactives in a way that allows for easy porting to a museum Web site. Planning for this from the start allows for flexibility from the developers.We also look at making the most of the hardware we use and keeping things flexible."

    "abstract": "This mini workshop will focus on the calendar sub-project of the Balboa Park Online Collaborative?s multi-institutional, Drupal Web site deployment. Like most cultural institution Web sites, the sites from BPOC member institutions have a significant emphasis on events ? exhibitions, lectures, classes, tours, performances, etc. Commercial calendar products are often not flexible enough to meet the specific needs of the cultural heritage field, forcing many museums to make do with inadequate calendaring systems at great expense. Additionally, the complexities of scheduling events on-line for museums and cultural institutions (e.g. a tour that takes place every other Monday, except for holidays, when it happens on Tuesday) often leads to either inefficient or, on the other end of the spectrum, overly complex calendaring software that non-technical staff are loathe to embrace and technical staff are loathe to support. Finally, in a multi-institutional environment like Balboa Park, there is significant need for a centralized, automated calendar system that will streamline workflows for marketing and publicity staff by simplifying the data entry process and allowing the institutions to both coordinate events with their neighbors and distribute accurate event information to other media outlets and social networks en masse."

    "abstract": "In 1997 the Media Lab of the University of Art and Design, the Helsinki University of Technology, and the University of Uppsala's Carolina Redviva Library, started a project aiming the digitization of an ancient Map of Mexico dated circa 1550. The original is a 114 cm x 78 cm painted parchment that showcases two different cultures and their conceptual forms of representation: ?European-Renaissance/map-landscape? and ?Mesoamerican Toponymical-Signs? (Le?n Portilla & Aguilera 1986). The map depicts places and activities in what is known today as Mexico City by the year 1550, just some decades after the ancient empire of the Aztecs, the city of ?Tenochtitlan?, was conquered by the Spaniards in 1521. The demonstration of the Map of Mexico 1550 shows the use of ImaNote (Image Annotation Notebook), a web-based multi-user tool that allows for displaying, annotating and linking to multimedia resources. The tool also allows the creation of communities of users that can link as well as sort through annotations. The “Digital-Signs of the Map of Mexico 1550” project can be used to bring further possibilities of scholarship around the Mesoamerican culture, since the annotations make easier to disseminate the analysis of the signs. These digital-signs can also be used as interpretation devices by archeologists, historians and researchers. In addition, they work as an image-gallery helping to visualize the formal characteristics of this kind of Indigenous writing. The tool, with its associated methods also allows comparing the signs with some other toponymical signs existing on other Mesoamerican maps, codex, stone monuments, and Colonial manuscripts."

From creating posters and replicating the Christine Keeler portrait in the 1990s, through Tattoos, to the current World Beach Project and Wedding Fashion sites, we have always tried to be true to our founding principle of encouraging creativity and involvement. We engage with our visitors also by inviting them to download high resolution images, buy tickets and publications, respond to polls, attend events, and visit us on YouTube and other sites and comment. In theory, some of these are two-way transactions, but the reality is different ,and what we have in the way of user generated content is quite disparate. You could say we have creativity without community; contribution without coherenceThis year the time came for a review. We have put a lot of energy into thinking how we might pull these interactions together to create greater involvement for our visitors and a clearer picture for us of our users and their needs. Approaches have varied through forming an on-line research group, upgrading our blogs, crowdsourcing photo crops on our new object database, through to building visitor profiles to collect and repurpose contributions. Drawing both on the experience of participants and on lessons from the V&A, this workshop will suggest ways of working with visitors to create increased community and coherence. The workshop will include practical activity; no technical expertise is required. Participants should leave with ideas they might put into practice in their own museum."

A Web-based multi-institutional museum commons could open up public access to collections, deepening contextual knowledge of objects and helping museum professionals recognize the unseen value of their own collections. For example, collections items that seem orphaned or fragmentary in one institution may enjoy a rich life on-line, once reunited with relevant collections and data from other institutions in an on-line commons environment. Commons-oriented intellectual property policies should also enable content sharing for educational and other non-commercial uses, or they may be used to facilitate new innovations or for-profit businesses beyond the scope of traditional rights-and-reproductions activities.The Smithsonian Institution and the Balboa Park on-line Collaborative (BPOC) are both large, multi-part organizations with diverse research and outreach missions: together they provide a unique opportunity to explore the potential of the commons model."

Focused on the particular design challenges faced by hands-on informal science centers, the program allows collaboration with remote teams to test and plan exhibits using virtual worlds and free online tools. With the Tech Virtual collaborative environment (http://www.thetechvirtual.org) curators can network with exhibit designers and topical experts to conceptualize, design and prototype individual exhibits or even an entire exhibition. With these tools, museum professionals can also develop visualizations of their projects to support funding requests or guide additional content creation. In this workshop, participants will learn how to format a design brief for exhibits at their institution which could benefit from online collaboration. They will submit exhibit proposals using The Tech Virtual, and experience the process of collaboratively prototyping one of the proposed exhibits online. We will also discuss the speed and cost benefits of collaborative development and virtual prototyping. With a laptop, participants will be able to actively begin projects during the session. For those without a laptop there will be printed activity sheets available for pen and paper participation. Chance favors the prepared mind, so come with an exhibit project in mind.

Lead presenters will be students Devyn Dennison and Veronica Black.The first project demonstrates how we are helping to make a rural community?s dream of a museum come true. Last summer, student Devyn Dennison (Navajo) wanted an internship near her family?s ranch in a remote area of the Navajo Nation. We connected with the Crownpoint History and Cultural Heritage Council (CHCHC). Collaboratively, we came up with an internship for Devyn to develop an exhibit about Navajo rodeo that will be presented as part of Crownpoint?s celebration of their centennial in 2010. We also became aware of Crownpoint?s desire for a museum or heritage center that will help them to preserve their history and culture, including providing online educational resources based on exhibits. Spring semester, our Exhibit Design class will develop a CHCHC website, redesign their electronic newsletter, and create a conceptual plan that will help them to secure a funding and a facility. The demo will feature the exhibit video reformatted for classroom use as a podcast, as well as museum concepts created by the Exhibit Design class.The second project demonstrates how we are helping a high-tech science museum to target new audiences. Last spring, on a class trip to Washington, D.C., the itinerary included a visit to the Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences. This small museum specializes in data-driven interactive displays based on NAS research projects and their role in informing national policies regarding controversial science-related issues. During the museum tour, director Patrice Legro talked about their current effort to rebrand and update their web presence. The students were eager to jump in, leading to a project for the fall Advanced Design class. The class divided up into competing teams to develop design comps. Dr. Legro picked the winners, who traveled to D.C. to shoot a virtual tour for the website. Though under no obligation, the museum is actually using the student design. The demo will feature the website redesign and virtual tour."

    "abstract": "Last year, Bean Creative?s 2009 Museums & the Web mini-workshop, Pimp My Website, covered free and easy tools and tactics to redesign the look and functionality of museum sites. The recipient of that graphic facelift and tech tools, The Museum of Russian Art (www.tmora.org) , won an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Interactive Media Awards in the Arts/Culture category as a result of the endeavor. Building off the proven success of the 2008 approach and results, this year Bean Creative will focus on tips and techniques to analyze and rethink museums? site architecture, usability and organization. Rearchitecting and reorganizing your site using the content you already have is a proven method to reengage visitors with your institution without having to go through the time, expense and effort of a full graphical redesign. By demonstrating ways to refresh, enliven and optimize content for museum audiences, you make your content shine without a redesign. Any time is a good time to optimize your site?s usability for your target audience ? even more so when the economic climate reduces budgets and staffing. Most institutions already have a wealth of legacy content that is still relevant and informative, but may not be organized or presented in a user-focused way that puts visitors? needs at the forefront. In this mini-workshop, we will showcase a variety of methodologies that you can use in rearchitecting your museum?s site for maximum impact. We?ll focus tools and techniques that help museums ensure audience and site goals will be achieved, the content structure is clear and that you have accommodated the essential top-level information needs to be featured on main and tertiary site pages. Starting with audience understanding and analysis, we?ll provide an overview of how to identify the needs and goals of diverse site visitors (researchers, teachers, students, parents, funders, etc.) to develop a comprehensive audience matrix, and explore different tactics that they take when exploring and searching for content of interest within your site. Moving on to organizational tactics, we?ll demonstrate the benefits of card sorting ? a reliable, inexpensive method for finding patterns in how users would expect to find content or functionality using simple blank paper cards. Then we?ll explore the best options in navigation structure and menu systems that maximize usability and intuitive use. Content reorganization strategies to be covered include how to create a content matrix that aligns with your site users, how to create and use content relationship flowcharts that map interconnections of and paths to site content, and the do?s and don?ts of developing and detailing wireframes to bring key content into focus with page placement and size relationships. Finally, the mini-workshop will cover best-practices for when and how to paper prototype and test during the rearchitecting process. As an added benefit, during the mini-workshop at the conference we will break session attendees into groups and guide them through a brief card sort exercise using a real museum website so they can practice and see the benefits for themselves."

Using real-life stories and examples from the post-launch lives of The Museum of Modern Art, New York (MoMA), the National Gallery, London (NG), and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), we will reflect upon the often overlooked and under-considered period in most on-line projects: post-launch.While our previous paper explored the shared joys and challenges we faced in planning, developing, and deploying new and improved institutional Web sites, this paper and subsequent presentation will offer pragmatic and candid insights into our lives after the launch. We'll reflect upon what we did right and what could have been done differently, discuss results that we expected to find and those that were a surprise, and recount some practical lessons learned. Some of the issues covered include the unexpected impact of a redesign on an organization's strategic planning, the sobering limitations of what a content management system (CMS) can and can't do, and the ongoing difficulties of measuring success. By continuing the discussions we began in our first paper, we hope to offer the wider museum community an opportunity to tap into the first-hand knowledge and experience we gained from our three respective projects."

From its backbone of data centres to trained personnel -- much of this work has been as valuable as it is invisible. In the end, however, audio-visual heritage is only of true value when it is accessible for people who can use and reuse it as they choose. Identifying these audiences and their needs is a first and necessary step before developing projects to accommodate them. On the other hand, we like to regard our audiences as valuable sources of information as well. Many heads are better than one when it comes to sourcing information about audio-visual heritage. Therefore, in many projects we try to engage these crowds as much as possible in our effort of gaining knowledge about our materials. In an interactive workshop setting, we would like to go deeper into these developments and start a dialogue about whether our thoughts are up to speed with other people?s views on these matters. We are organizing our workshop around short presentations (5-10 min) of our past and present projects, which we think are typical of our concerns with access, openness and (creative) reuse. Which projects worked out well and which did not? What are other people?s experiences with similar activities? Listed hereunder are some of our own projects we want to discuss. Projects | past: Celluloid Remix ? a remix contest in which participants gave their vision of progress, reusing a collection of early Dutch cinema (1917 ? 1932) \"Waisda?\" / What?s that? ? a crowdsourcing game for collecting user-generated metadata for audio-visual content WikiLovesArt/NL ? free content photography contest among 45 Dutch museums and cultural institutions aimed at illustrating Wikipedia articles. Projects | present: Open Images? an open media platform that offers online access to a selection of audio-visual archive materials to stimulate creative reuse. T-Visionarium Open City ? a spectacular video installation that allows visitors to explore and edit a multitude of stories in 3 dimensions, on a 360?, full surround screen.M Projects | future: Augmented Reality / travelling exhibition."

This shift towards a more social, collective user generated Internet has been named Web 2.0. The current development on the Internet is also affecting the museums and their presence on-line. In cooperation with three art institutions we have developed a product called KuratorTool which is based on this new technology, where the user is acknowledged as a producer and distributor of knowledge. This paper will investigate how the museum as an institution and the traditional museum user will both change in a virtual world that is dominated by social technologies where the user is the creative part."

The aim of this action research project is to explore whether wikis can provide a low-cost, sustainable way of increasing interest and participation in the preservation, interpretation and enjoyment of local history and heritage collections. The target organisations to use the wiki are generally very small and are often staffed solely by volunteers. The pilot implementation in a small rural community has been well received and is generating significant levels of interest and participation. This paper aims to share the learning from this project about the potential and implications of wikis as the basis for sustainable knowledge communities around local history and heritage. It explores how collaborative knowledge-making practices such as crowdsourcing present new challenges and opportunities for museums, their information management paradigms, and their relationships with communities."

    "abstract": "The Illinois State Museum's Audio-Video Barn contains over 300 hours of oral history interviews pertaining to agriculture in Illinois. The interviews range in date from new sessions recorded in 2007-2009 to archival sessions recorded between 1952 and 1993. The memories recorded in these interviews stretch from 2009 back to the 1880s. Other associated data, such as photographs and transcriptions, are also available in the A-V Barn.The challenge was how to provide flexible navigation, filtering, and searching of these multimedia clips, while maintaining as much of the context and voice of the interviews as possible. Using the digital-indexing software InterClipper, we cut each audio or video interview into short topic-based clips and indexed them using controlled-word vocabularies. This resulted in over 3500 clips of durations ranging from 30 seconds to 12 minutes, each indexed by topics. However, InterClipper cannot be served to the Web, so after some review we decided to use the CMS software Drupal for our display framework. After editing the content in desktop applications such as MS Access, we migrated the data into MySQL and then developed a series of PHP scripts to transform the data in preparation for migration into the Drupal framework. Once the data were brought into Drupal, standard community-supported plug-in modules could be used to display, organize, search, and filter the interviews based on the subject indexes. Although the steps we took are particular to the data and goals of this project, the basic methods could be applied to any set of oral history sessions."

Museums can reach out to their audiences in more ways, using blogs, podcasts, video, and social media, but can they meaningfully engage visitors using games?

This paper examines the pedagogical integration of museum Web resources through teacher surveys, focus groups, classroom observations and a case study from the Museum of London. This variety of qualitative sources, coupled with Web site statistics, helps build a picture of classroom practice. Understanding how teachers use digital assets and interactives in planning and instruction provides useful insight when developing resources for school audiences. An example of how these considerations were put into practice is explored through the Museum of London's development of the Great Fire of London Web site (www.fireoflondon.org.uk) ."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design, development and evaluation of eTreasure, an application which exploits mobile technologies for the development of engaging outdoor learning experiences in the cultural heritage domain for primary and secondary school classes. eTreasure has been developed and tested in Lugano, a small city in the South of Switzerland. The city blends Italian culture and Swiss hospitality, and enjoys a rich cultural heritage, from Renaissance frescoes to modern architecture by Mario Botta. Lugano is a common destination of primary and secondary school trips from all over the region; we asked ourselves how such school trip could be made engaging and memorable for children, rather than simply some hours out of the classroom? Capitalizing on the results of an eTourism project, and in collaboration with the city school district, we developed a SMS-based treasure hunt for school classes from grades 8-12. The challenge was using mobile technologies for blending curriculum-relevant content into an engaging activity fostering observation, learning and retention in a powerful informal learning experience. The learning goals were: (a) fostering the observation of details in cultural heritage and stimulating meaningful learning; (b) enhancing team-work attitudes and skills; and (c) making the learning of history, geography and fine arts fun and worth remembering in connection with cultural heritage locations. The development of the game was the result of a team activity with primary and secondary school teachers, content experts, game designers and technologists. The playing and learning experience blends technology-supported and non-technological activities in preparation, on-site and follow-up activities. From a technological point of view, the system exploits both mobile and web technologies for a seamless experience. Small groups of children follow the hints they receive via SMS, identify hotspots on their map, and run for it. It can be a church, a monument, a square, which they will have to explore in detail in order to answer questions and earn points. During May and June 2008, four primary school classes for a total of over 100 children, played the treasure hunt with great success. The evaluation followed a method based on direct observation, data collection through surveys involving students, teacher and families, and interviews with teachers. While the learning results met the expectations, the engagement of children was more than expected, making the school trip a memorable adventure and a topic for discussion at home. The fun of the experience came from the competition that develops among the groups of 4-6 students and, of course, form the use of mobile technologies, which have deep penetration in that age group and are usually forbidden at school. Fun turned into motivation to play the game and observe and learn in order to win."

    "abstract": "How can museums employ new media to enhance their visitors' experience and their collections' accessibility? With the Internet moving into the public domain through wireless connections, broadband mobile telephony, and location-aware technology, museums are no longer bound by their physical limits (the building), but can use all relevant spaces, be it the city, the country or the public domain.Technology enables audiences to access, produce, and share media everywhere and at all times, and museums are quite far on in digitizing large parts of their collections. The combination of 24-hour on-line audience availability and rich digitised cultural musem content brings ample opportunities to create new cultural experiences.In this context, Waag Society recently developed a number of projects in which users are guided by mobile technology. The paper gives an overview of these projects and argues that the physical non-institutional environment is a great setting for appreciating cultural content and inducing active user participation."

In this paper, we examine the reasons and benefits for aggregating this type of data, how our approach differs to other funded projects that have similar aspirations, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. An analysis of the data is presented, showing how the aggregate data set varies by assorted parameters, including location and date.

    "year": "2009",
    "abstract": "Over the last decades, the museum sector made many efforts to shift the focus from objects to visitor groups and their overall experience of the visit. One of the strategies applied to improve the visitor experience, was the development of interactive mobile guides. This strategy clearly pays off to make museum visits more attractive, especially for visitor groups that are traditionally difficult to win over, like youngsters. The applicability, effect and behaviour of these kind of technologies however, remain hard for museums or heritage sites to assess. Moreover, every museum or heritage site has its own specific context according to which a mobile guide implementation should be tailored. Content presentation (narrative, thematic ...), location (indoor or outdoor, proximity of the objects ...), scale (duration of an average visit, extent of the museum or site), target groups ... all take part in the complex context that constitutes a visit. To meet the variety of contexts a mobile guide should respond to, there is a clear need for a generic, though flexible, framework that aids in the realization of context-specific mobile guides. We created such a generic mobile guide framework. This framework supports three core services that contribute to an overall visitor experience in accordance with the context of the visit: location-detection, personalization and communication. On top of this software framework, several mobile guides can be developed. In this way, we provide a flexible solution to tailor mobile guides to the specific requirements of the target environment. In the ARCHIE project, we used this framework to develop a mobile museum game for youngsters, visiting a museum during a school trip. Large scale evaluations have shown the potential power of our approach both to enhance the motivation and increase the attractiveness of museum learning and heritage education for this target group. Based on our experiences in designing and evaluating our mobile game, we propose a set of basic guidelines that steer the realization of educational mobile games for youngsters. These guidelines are applicable for both heritage sites and the cultural and tourist sector. The main guidelines we present relate to: the design process and the involvement of the end-user throughout this process; designing (game) concepts that capture the key content of the museum or site and create good learning environments; designing for social interaction and collaborative learning; the importance of an evocative graphical design. Our experience building mobile guides for the cultural and tourist sector, revealed a strong need for further guidance with regard to the realization of mobile ICT solutions. To meet this demand, we are currently setting up an expertise centre that includes a demo- and test-infrastructure in which prototypes of different institutions can be tested and evaluated. This infrastructure gives us the opportunity to refine and steer the guidelines proposed above and to verify mobile guide solutions in different contexts. In this way, the centre allows us to offer full support for the development process of a mobile ICT application for the cultural and tourist sector."

In a relatively large museum organisation like Museum Victoria, you need to ensure you have a common internal sense of purpose before you can entice the world to your on-line experiences. In order to succeed we realised, after some false starts, that we had to lead an extensive consultation process across many levels of the organisation. Outcomes included structural changes, where we consolidated the on-line team , created an on-line steering committee, and created on-line strategic documents endorsed by the Executive Management Team and the Board. This paper will present the challenges we faced in managing the creation of a common on-line strategy and framework at Museum Victoria.

These technologies have created new ways to connect with and engage new audiences. [1, 2] New ways of publishing video online emerge constantly, leaving us the difficult task of determining the best option. [3] There are many factors that can influence our choices: the type of audience, quality of video playback, access to users, platform features, APIs, and much more. Instead of just jumping from one video service to another, is there a more strategic way of thinking about this content delivery? The Indianapolis Museum of Art has been active in the field of museum video for the past three years and has pioneered award winning web sites and applications that leverage this video content. But, the process of choosing where and how to distribute these videos was difficult. After a series of attempts, trends and characteristics of these different options began to emerge. IMA staff members will discuss their experiences with video deployment strategies including reasons why museums may choose one platform over another. We will illustrate some of these reasons using statistics and analysis of IMA."

The main focus of discussion during the forum was on open content and use of Creative Commons licences, with additional discussions covering open standards and open source software. But the next step in opening up the museum sector might be the exploitation of open APIs and greater use of Software as a Service (SaaS). What are the potential benefits which Open APIs and SaaS seek to provide? What about the associated risks in moving from an environment in which software is installed and managed either locally or by a hosting agency with formal contractual agreements to a environment in which there may be no formal agreements, the services may be hosted in different countries and governed by different legal frameworks? And at a time of global economic uncertainties is it sensible to be seeking to make use of Open APIs and SaaS at the current time? This mini-workshop will seek to encourage open discussion and debate on these questions. The outcomes of the mini-workshop will be an awareness of ways in which open APIs and SaaS are being exploited within the sector and a better understanding of the approaches which should be taken in order to maximise the potential benefits of this approach."

Museums offer a wide range of collections, including digitized representations of art, natural history, material culture, and historical archival photographs. Virtual access has become a vital means of both enabling collection access and facilitating outreach beyond the physical museum. But how much do we know of our audiences, and how do they make use of such collections? What are their motivations and behaviours?The importance of evaluating on-line collection offerings has been noted in several recent studies. A clearer understanding of just how and why on-line collections are used is vital if we are to appropriately plan enhancements to collection access, such as visitor tagging, visitor contributed content, and other Web 2.0 features.In examining the use of the CN Images of Canada Gallery, an on-line archival collection, this paper explores the practical application of analytical approaches that may be broadly applicable to on-line collections as a whole. Making use of common data sources, the case study creates a rounded picture of how a collection is actually used by visitors. The findings should be broadly usable as a basis of comparison with other collections and their use, as institutions prepare for the next iteration of their on-line offerings."

The first wave of the project has included three innovative tools. A customisable search builder lets people design their own search widget to find the type of New Zealand content they are interested in. New Zealanders can craft their own commemoration of the 90th Anniversary of the Armistice using the Memory Maker - a tool that lets people remix film, photographs, objects and audio clips into a short video that can then be saved, shared, and embedded. Finally, an open API enables developers to connect the metadata that fuels DigitalNZ with other data sources, enabling new digital experiences, knowledge, and understanding."

    "abstract": "School-based users, both students and educators, have always been a primary target audience for museum on-line content. Museums and other cultural organisations have made significant investments in developing and disseminating content on-line to reach and engage these users. Yet despite the obvious logic of this connection, in practice it has proven difficult to build effective permanent bridges between the wealth of museum digital content and the classroom environment. While many individual institutions host outstanding educational content on their individual Web sites, this material may remain inaccessible or under utilised in a classroom environment due to technology and security constraints, or simply through lack of awareness or discoverability. We are yet to develop effective and sustainable supply chains of museum digital content from multiple institutions for use in classroom environments. In Australia and Canada two new national approaches to solving the supply chain problem have been developed by two agencies working with museum organisations to facilitate the flow of content into classroom environments. This paper examines the imperatives driving these initiatives and the lessons learned in creating an integrated national approach to developing digital supply chains for school-based users of museum content."

    "year": "2009",
    "abstract": "The open editing framework that wikis enable is an excellent way for museums to engage audiences on-line: wikis allow collaboration, and museums seek public participation and a venue for debate. The Science Museum Object Wiki and The British Postal Museum & Archive (BPMA) Wiki were both launched separately by the authors of this paper in early 2008. Although they use similar wiki software, they differ in their aims and objectives, in their methods of engaging their audiences, and in the types of audience behaviour that have arisen. This paper introduces and evaluates both wikis. Using them as examples, it goes on to demonstrate the benefits of wikis for museums, as well as the challenges. Understanding the reasons behind the reticence on the part of certain audiences to participate, the authors suggest the 'problem' may lie in the perceived authority of the museum itself."

Blogs, wikis, podcasts, vodcasts, photo and video sharing, virtual environments, tagging, annotation and other authoring tools offer people new opportunities to engage with museum content processes through co-creation and interactive cultural experiences. Arguably, these platforms and tools are creating new relationships between institutions and the public.We contend that to create sustained participation in social media spaces, museums need to reconsider their relationships with the public and thoroughly explore user motivations and intentions for participation in social media activities. We suggest some ways in which museums might design and evaluate their social media initiatives to ensure their success and sustainability, and offer some questions for further research."

    "abstract": "At SFMOMA, an interpretive goals process has been instituted to bring together curators, educators, educational technologists and other concerned parties to design the interpretive “menu” for exhibitions once they are put on the schedule. The result is a transition from the old model of “technology as remediation” — in which kiosks were placed at the end of an exhibition (or on another floor altogether) while visitors were often left clueless before the art itself — to a mix of analog and digital resources, designed and dosed to meet visitor needs as they arise. The result may be a net decrease in technological interventions, but arguably a more effective use of technology when it is deployed. Three case studies illustrate the range of responses to this process, and the development of technology solutions at a variety of scales and budgets, with varying degrees of success. Results of recent evaluations of mobile tours, both cell phone and multimedia-based, are included, as well as indications for future directions stemming from this action research."

    "abstract": "The enormous popularity of computer and videogames (Lenhard et al. 2008), and the inherent pedagogical qualities of such games (Gee 2003, Squire et al. 2003) has inspired many efforts to create games that successfully fuse compelling gameplay with learning goals. This session examines the results of one such effort. WolfQuest is a 3D wildlife simulation game developed by Eduweb and the Minnesota Zoo, funded by the National Science Foundation, and distributed on-line as a free download for Mac and Windows computers. With over 250,000 game downloads and 30,000 multiplayer game sessions per month, the game has definitely found an audience. But are these players learning what we intended? Summative evaluation found that players do indeed report knowledge gain, stronger emotional attachment to wolves, and significant behavioral outcomes, with large percentages of players following their game sessions with other wolf-related activities, including such further explorations of wolves on the Internet, in books and on television. This paper details the evaluation results from the summative evaluation, discusses the theory behind the project, and reflects on our experience developing the game."

Recently several commercial offerings have generated a lot of attention for their potential to revolutionize the way business computing is conducted. The field has already seen several interesting and innovative business models spring up with their core computing process firmly anchored in the cloud (Horrigan, 2008). Does the same hold true for museums? What are the benefits and risks associated with moving our institutional computing to the cloud? Is cloud computing a viable option for hosting the rich media and content common to many museums today, or is it still vaporware in need of more time? This paper discusses these questions and poses suggestions regarding how museums can begin to utilize cloud computing services."

Reverse-geocoding is the inverse process used to translate machine-generated geographic data in to place names that people can understand and relate to. History and geography remain powerful anchors by which we orient ourselves to our communities and the world at large. This is reflected in the practice and evolution of story-telling and the naming of place and the disputes that sometimes follow. As locative technologies play an increasingly important role in all aspects of daily life so too will the ability to interpret and contextualize the abundance of data produced in the precise but distant language of machines. This paper will examine both the technical and conceptual challenges involved in naming geographic \"places\" focusing on a variety of models used by different social networking sites with an emphasis on the approaches used by Flickr to identify and label geotagged photos and to allow community input when errors or conflicts occur."

Can heritage institutions with limited financial and human resources develop these types of projects sustainably? To find out, between November 2007 and July 2008, Parks Canada staff developed and launched three handheld GPS-triggered tours. The process of developing the tours was monitored closely throughout the 8-month development period, and feedback gathered from team members and other staff. Then during the two-month pilot period, over 1000 visitors used the devices; regular feedback was provided by both users and staff.The project had many positive outcomes, including recommendations for streamlining the development process and product delivery, a better understanding of the target audience, and suggestions for improving the usability and effectiveness of the devices."

It now has 18 separate channels on YouTube alone and more than 1300 subscribers. But we have a nagging question: how can on-line video spark physical visits and deeper engagements at, and with, our science centre? YouTube itself suggested an answer in the spontaneous emergence of large-scale in-person gatherings of site users called meetups in 2007.

The original motivation is to bring online and connect existing isolated heritage collections, to incorporate them into tourism and education initiatives. Thus, a guiding principle has been to reduce incorporation barriers to institutions, whether economic, technological, methodological, or institutional. Participating repositories may be physically scattered and may have different policies for role-based access, intellectual property, bandwidth management, and so on; these differences are actively managed. Another key difference (lost in many similar projects) is tolerance to maturity diversity, ranging from full digitalization and indexation to imprecise descriptions of coarse units (e.g. collections). Digital contents can queried and explored as a unified collection, using three global semantic contexts that the system maintains: of the artifacts themselves, of their digital renderings, and of the circumstances that they witness to. Users and providers keep their own contexts, and the system can formulate personalized recommendations based on profiles, history, nearness, and other criteria. Context/SR is a middleware platform, enabling third-parties and community to build clients; under current construction are Web-based Heritage Explorator, mobile tourist-support applications, and bridges to external repositories."

These applications produce powerful, easy-to-use search and discovery tools. These 'semantic' tools and techniques have not been applied to museum collections. Some '2.0' have begun to see application in the museum domain, but have not been integrated into a common framework. We describe the Delphi framework of semantic tools and community annotation for museum collections. The toolkit includes linguistic analysis tools, services that produce an easy-to-use faceted browsing user interface (UI) that makes it simple and fun to explore and understand museum collections. Personalization and social media tools allow creation and sharing of favorite sets of objects. The tools abstract the core technologies, and so can be used by designers and information architects without requiring specialized technical knowledge. We deployed Delphi for the large collections at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology with good success. We describe our experience with this deployment and lessons learned along the way. We explain the major components of the Delphi open source toolkit, and we discuss ongoing research that builds upon the platform."

We propose a model that identifies generic requirements for spatiotemporal cultural heritage Web sites. The model helps to understand how well different implementation environments suit various objectives. The model is applied to our own cultural landscape portal on the region around the Vecht, a small river which runs from the city of Utrecht to the north, at both sides fringed by a rich historical landscape."

    "abstract": "Museum collections are increasingly linked to global networks and flows of information. Google-enabled initiatives and the placement of collections information and images in social spaces (YouTube, FlickR, MySpace) allow them to be linked to wider social, cultural contexts, used in unexpected ways in debates, and for political agendas within public culture . Interactions with collections, some planned, others serendipitous, are now happening through these multiple and extended connections of people, ideas and objects, across long distances and national boundaries. Collections space and the meanings, values and significances attributed to them can no longer be considered fixed, given or separate. It is now dynamic, less predictable and networked (Cameron and Mengler 2007). This paper discusses conceptual work undertaken for the Australian Research Council research project Reconceptualising Heritage Collections with the Centre for Cultural Research, University of Western Sydney and the Powerhouse Museum. It offers some possible solutions on how museums and collections might operate as complex systems according to Latour's (2005) idea of object-orientated democracies. Here I draw on the results of qualitative research, conversations and workshops with curators, and globally networked communities presenting models for transdisciplinary and socially embedded practices in collections documentation."

    "abstract": "All over the world museum Web site visitation is growing as better access and faster speeds increase Internet traffic to all categories of Web sites. Museums are increasingly experimenting with and implementing more interactive services on their own Web sites, and also decentralising their on-line 'brand' into a multiplicity of social networking sites and services, as well as virtual worlds. This increased environmental complexity makes the traditional Web analytics and metrics that museums have used to measure and track success on the Web for the past decade increasingly inadequate. Occasional user surveys and server-side log analysis can no longer be relied upon by Web teams to guide them towards making museum sites more user-centric and effective. This is complicated further by the greater and greater proportion of on-line museum visitors entering the sites via a search engine. Whilst basic reporting currently satisfies government and sometimes corporate benefactors, far more complex analysis is required for museums themselves to more effectively evaluate and refine their on-line offerings for their users. This paper argues that museums must take another look at their analytics tools and methods. It calls for a new approach and examines new ways of measuring the use of on-line museum projects and Web sites. It looks at the new range of analysis tools available to Web teams and, referencing the broader segmentation work of Peacock and Brownbill (2007), proposes practical ways a segmented approach can work for museums of all sizes. It proposes that museums need to take stock of their comparative positioning in each of these segments, rather than use raw figures. Drawing upon search engine optimisation techniques and demand-side competitive ISP-level intelligence, it combines these with new site-specific techniques to allow museums to better learn how their existing users behave on their Web sites, as well as to identify the potential audience for their offerings, one that is currently untapped. (This paper is intended to accompany a practical workshop which demonstrates, with examples, many of the concepts and techniques described within.)"

    "abstract": "This paper reports on the early phases of a pilot project which is mashing up datasets from across several museums with data from other government departments. Can we liberate museum data and combine it with other live external data sets to create new value and use? If so, what kinds of meaning can we help people make? What do we need to do to the underlying museum data? What are the technologies that allow us to aggregate this data long after it was created for other purposes?"

    "abstract": "The EU-funded MultiMatch project aims to overcome language barriers, and media and distribution problems currently affecting access to on-line cultural heritage material. Partners are developing a vertical search engine able to harvest heterogeneous information from distributed sources and present it in a synthesized manner. To design such a system, user requirements were initially gathered and then translated into specific design features to ensure that the search engine developed was consistent with user needs. This paper presents these user requirements, the initial design of the MultiMatch system, and technical discussion of the system architecture and components used to turn these design implications into a working interactive prototype. Following this, we discuss user evaluation and present results from an initial user study. These are being used, in addition to other input, to drive the functionality and design of the final system."

    "abstract": "Social networking sites have achieved a critical mass of popularity in an astonishingly short period of time. Sites such as Facebook have become part of mass culture, and now rank among the most popular sites on the Web. These sites are radically changing on-line behaviours in the process. Museums are frequently represented in these spaces, whether or not they actively participate. This paper examines social networking sites as a distinct, strategic point of presence for museums. It studies specific experiments with social media, including a detailed analysis of a Facebook group used by the Canada Science and Technology Museum Corporation's Membership Program. It applies two theoretical models ? the \"Innovation Radar\" and genre analysis ? to help analyze the nature of the opportunities for innovation, and to develop a better understanding of the distinctive characteristics of alternate communication channels. It looks closely at the new value that can be generated from such experiments, such as audience engagement and new avenues for research. It explores the challenges of measuring success with emerging media, and how organizational objectives and measures can affect the decisions institutions make in participating in on-line social networks. It also considers how these sites may create both organizational challenges and opportunities by enabling greater involvement in innovation and audience engagement by a broader base of museum participants."

Active users of sites bring an understanding of their potential and applications within museums and so does a risk-taking 'suck-it-and-see' attitude. Learning by experiment helps us draw in the users we never see and some of the best activities are founded on imagination rather than money. The aim of the workshop is to provide a large number of relatively simple workable ideas that people might take away and adapt to their own museums."

    "year": "2008",
    "abstract": "In the provision of networked services for museums, the term 'openness' crops up in a variety of contexts including open standards and open source software. In addition, the Web 2.0 environment has led to increased interest in open content and in the use of freely available networked applications which may be regarded as open services. This focus on openness for the developer or service provider can be complemented with a culture of openness which encourages the users to actively engage with services and generate their own content. It can be difficult to argue against the benefits which openness seeks to provide. But will a commitment to openness guarantee the deployment of effective and sustainable services? This paper explores in more detail the potential benefits of openness, but also acknowledges associated limitations. The authors argue that a more sophisticated approach is needed: one which seeks to make use of open standards, open source and open content if these can help to deliver sustainable services, but is prepared to take a more flexible approach if the perceived difficulties are felt to outweigh possible benefits."

    "abstract": "ECHO (Education through Cultural and Historical Organizations) is a federally-supported collaborative of six cultural institutions that spans the US (Alaska, Hawai'i, Mississippi and Massachusetts). ECHO's founding legislation requires it to create cultural programming and use ?modern technology, including the internet, to educate students, their parents and teachers? about historic and contemporary links between Native and non-Native peoples. ECHO creates exhibitions, public programming, web sites and other educational tools and materials drawing on cross-cultural understanding and place- and culture-based learning experiences. ECHO's most recent web project is Learning from the People, a sub-site on WGBH's site Teachers' Domain. It draws on both Native and 'standard' (Euro-American) sources to examine two themes: traditional storytelling in the Native world, and Arctic climate change. The raw materials were the diverse sources of information and experience of our six member institutions: a bewildering array widely varying in quality, quantity and medium, with limited cataloging or indexing. Drawing on these, we created video and interactive resources, background essays and discussion questions that supported lesson plans correlated to state and national educational standards. Presently the collaborative is expanding its own site, ECHOspace.org, to incorporate the contents of Learning from the People, as well as interactive space for members of our communities, more extensive data resources for life-long learners, professional development for teachers, interactive experiences for young children based in our various cultures and collections, and a 'back-room' suite of tools to create and manage our various projects. As we head into creation of the new site, several questions/insights seem important: 1) Teachers' classroom use of pre-configured lesson plans is limited, but they may use them as search tags to find ideas and illustrative resources. Is it important to create lesson plans as such? Can good meta-tagging replace them? 2) As cultural institutions we serve vastly differing audiences. Digital technology may allow reconfiguration of single database through creation of portals configured for distinct audiences. Can we find ways to let visitors create their own portals, which can be shared with others? 3) Knowledge transfer in both Native and museum communities are rooted in 'place' and its corollary 'presence'. Web and standards-based systems have been characterized as 'placeless', therefore antithetical to museum and Native values. Standards can, though, offer 'interoperability', through which culture-based knowledge can be linked to national norms through systems created to integrate the two, allowing place-based education on a national scale. 4) Templates/guidelines for lesson plans and resources allow ECHO to incorporate widely diverse data sources into a recognizable format. It permits creation of new resources by diverse partners to be added to the database into the future, with minimal oversight. This interactive session, led by Daniel Elias, ECHO project director, and Jim Forrest, Web Designer, of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, will explore our process and the applicability of our process to other cultural organizations."

In this context, the CHIP (Cultural Heritage Information Personalization) project offers tools to the users to be their own curators; e.g. for planning a personalized museum tour, discovering interesting artworks they want to see in a 'virtual' or a 'real' tour, and quickly finding their way in the museum. In this paper we present the new additions to the CHIP tools to target the above functionality - a Web-based Tour Preparation Wizard and an export of a personalized tour to an interactive Mobile Guide used in the physical museum space. In addition, the user interactions during a real museum visit are stored and synchronized with the user model, which is maintained at the museum Web site."

How does one serve these diverse needs efficiently on one platform? How can we implement an accessible learning environment which can be customised to different learning styles? The approach chosen in this project is to provide two basic features: target group profiles and user customization. Target group profiles indicate the different aims that various users have when accessing the Web site. In addition, users themselves are able to tailor the site according to personal learning styles and needs: visually or textually oriented users are able to configure their view of the Museum with a bias towards textual or multimedia material. From an information technology point of view, the overall task has been to provide the infrastructure needed to enable and preferably enhance the intended features, while getting in the way as little as possible between the content and the visitor. The resulting Web of interconnected information resources and subjects significant to this application both invokes curiosity and provides the visitor with a highly intuitive way of acquiring knowledge."

These technologies can also be used to enhance a visitor's experience by transforming it from a passive role to that of an active participant in an exhibition. Despite the relative ease of implementing Web 2.0 technologies, a wide range of issues need to be addressed at the start of a project, such as security, in-house or out-of-house software application management, whether or not to monitor user-generated content (and if so, how) and assessment. Interaction participants will be encouraged to share their experiences regarding the development of different kinds of social networks (professional, educational, visitor participatory, etc) and the specific tools and processes chosen. By identifying different initiatives, tools and processes, we will learn together how to improve our best practices as well as to create new forms of museum content that enhance visitors experiences. Discussion ideas will include strategies on the integration of user generated audio, video and text into both practical and virtual exhibitions, multi-institutional collaborations for education and research. Some of the tools that will be introduced will include wikis, e-portfolios, steve.museum, nexhibition, mobile-to-web technologies (Gabcast, flickr, etc), calendaring and scheduling. Additionally, I will present a paper summarizing the results of my research the integration of Social Networking tools into museum environments and will provide participants a current list of web links to 2.0 tools and sites."

Dane-zaa Stories and Songs: Dreamers and the Land. This exhibit was produced by the First Nation in collaboration with ethnographers, linguists, and multimedia professionals. It integrates subtitled Dane-zaa and English video narratives, interpretive e-text, photographs of the production process, recordings of songs, and contemporary and archival images of traditional lands in order to showcase Dane-zaa culture and address present concerns faced by the community as they negotiate legacies of colonialism. The exhibit's community-directed production process has contributed to the revitalization of Dane-zaa culture and language as it brought elders and youth together to document stories, songs, and their relationship to the land. The project has also provided the First Nation with control over their representation, and has become a valuable learning resource for local and global audiences. Presented by the exhibit co-curators and project coordinators, the demonstration and paper will showcase the exhibition and discuss questions, raised in the exhibit production process, which relate to the politics of cultural representation in the context of museums and the Web: How can curators and communities balance the benefits of sharing Indigenous culture with protecting Indigenous culture? Can consensus be reached over what is appropriate to show a worldwide audience versus a local audience? How is local intellectual property rights discourse constituted? And how do these emerging rights contribute to the development of protocols for meaningful consultation with Aboriginal communities?"

Digital images displayed on the Web sites of universities worldwide are generally made available through digitizing slide collections, subscribing to digital libraries of art history images, making use of faculty's personal images and using university library catalogues. When creating a collection of art history images, Russian universities are severely limited by budget constraints, staff problems and change-management difficulties. But creating a visual resource base can be made possible through launching a volunteer research project with researchers from various university departments. Siberian museums and research centres contributed by studying standards of creating visual information resources, building an art history image database, developing cataloguing tools, and involving students in research projects, as well as doing the practical work of creating an art history image library."

    "abstract": "The website ArtPad: A Collection. A Connection has ambitious goals. At its core is the online presentation of works from the Glenbow Museum's contemporary art collection, an exceptional collection that is not often presented to the public. Simple enough, but we also wanted to present the collection to an untapped audience for the museum: teenagers. Further, we strove to present the content in an educational context, yet in a way that high school art students would want to receive and interact with the artwork, with each other, and with the museum. Ideally, this balance of (presented) museum content and Web 2.0 functionality will create user dialogues about the artwork featured and contemporary art in general, and user reactions to the art they can create and post on ArtPad. The needs and preferences of the intended user were at the fore during development of ArtPad. Sample audience groups were consulted throughout the development process and research was conducted on how this audience group learns and prefers to receive information. Will this evaluation pay-off? Will young art aficionados be engaged enough by the artwork and the content presented to begin interacting with it, expressing their own views and questions about contemporary art and creating their own artwork? This paper will focus on the user evaluation process employed to develop the site, the features and components developed specifically for the target audience, and the Web 2.0 components used to create and build discussion around contemporary art practice. ArtPad dispenses with the traditional curatorial stance ? that of one authoritative voice ? and instead opens the discourse to users. This curatorial view, user statistics and feedback, and responses and reactions from artists featured on the site will also be addressed in the paper."

    "year": "2008",
    "abstract": "Effective project management is crucial to the success of almost any project. This management can be difficult when faced with an ambitious project on a tight schedule where project partners are scattered across many miles. Museums face these challenges every day as they coordinate and plan new exhibitions, website content and educational programming. Managing the unknowns of project and budgets is a reality for most museum professionals, but delivering results that are on time and meet expectations is often a difficult task. Other communities share our difficulties with project management. In seeking to mitigate these difficulties, the software development community has worked to create project management methods that seek to quantify the risks and scheduling difficulties inherent in any project. In this paper, we will share how the application of Agile methods for project management have impacted the creation, collaboration and development of tools in support of the steve research project, a collaboration to research the role and usefulness of social tagging as it applies to museum collections. We will go on to describe the features and benefits of agile project management and explain why they might be useful for a broad range of collaborative projects conducted by the museum community. The agile methods we adopted center around a base unit of work called a \"story.\" A story is a short description of any task explained in such a way that all team members can understand its meaning. Software developers expand stories into a set of technical requirements needed to accomplish the work while the client can be assured that they understand what the software will do when complete. Agile development consists of short iterative cycles, no longer than two weeks. Our team worked together to estimate effort for each cycle by assigning point values to each story. Meeting on weekly phone calls, the team was able to move quickly through stories, and became better at estimating the time required to complete tasks by understanding the time implications of point estimates. Agile methods lead to a better group understanding of project effort by voting on story point values. This voting forced communication about what it will take to accomplish any particular story. Short cycles reinforced the accuracy of point estimates and encouraged trust between team members. Short work cycles also allowed us to quickly adapt to changing requirements and circumstances. Quality of work was insured through formal checks and balances, User Acceptance Testing and Team Retrospectives evaluating past experience. Agile development methods have proven to be a valuable tool in the software profession for many years. The experience of the steve research project seems to indicate that these methods can also be very useful in transforming the way that museum professionals can work together across disciplines and on a wide variety of projects."

The adventure of developing this simple, smart, fast and fun map-based publication platform started early in 2005. At that time Google Maps and Google Earth were still to be launched, and map-based applications were 'for professionals'.

The purpose of the project is to get the vast amount of content already on these national museum and gallery websites better used through the creation of online resources. To enable the websites to be better used the outcomes will based on the partner websites within a peer-to-peer environment rather than a central portal. The enabling of end-users to efficiently search across the partner collections was deemed crucial for these online resources. While the project is still under development, a substantial amount of technical resources have gone into investigating the federated search and the possible approaches. All of the approaches have issues associated with them and can be used for different purposes within different types of projects. This paper addresses the questions around these types of federated searching and debates the models and possible solutions for the sector. It is hoped that the technical processes and models developed in the project will go some way to providing future frameworks for searching standards within the Cultural sector."

    "year": "2008",
    "abstract": "Most current efforts in social tagging by museums focus on how to improve public access to on-line collections. Indeed, tags do supplement existing documentation by providing an alternative vocabulary to describe works of art. But what can tags tell us about how images are perceived? Are the same images perceived differently by viewers from diverse cultures? Taking its cue from the steve project's (http://steve.museum) research agenda, an ongoing study funded by the Rubin Museum of Art explores what tags reveal about the ways native communities respond to their own cultural iconography. Begun in March 2007, the study is collecting tags on Tibetan artworks from Tibetans and Westerners in Switzerland and New York on a customized steve installation (http://www.seeingtibetanart.org). Preliminary findings based on the Swiss data reveal: 1) different tagging and viewing patterns among Tibetans and Westerners; 2) complex and often awkward feelings young Tibetans experience when viewing traditional artworks; 3) clearly discernible levels of cultural pervasiveness of traditional images; and 4) shared misunderstandings about specific types of images. One of the first formal studies in the domain of social tagging, and perhaps the first to gather tags from a diaspora community, this project employs a mixed-methods approach that combines tags with ethnographic interviews and observations. It offers valuable insights for museums in three areas: 1) how Tibetan art is perceived by Tibetan and Western viewers; 2) analytical approaches that can help contextualize social tags; and 3) ideas and suggestions on designing tagging systems for native communities."

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, digital content has gained importance in cultural heritage institutions. Video and picture material is being digitized in order to manage the large amount of content with ease. Digital data can be administered using databases that allow the addition of meta information as well as manipulation of certain media (e.g. dust and flicker reduction on historic film material). Digitized versions of film and audio documents and digital images of objects (paintings, statues, architecture ?) can also be used to attract a larger audience by making available previews of exhibitions on the Web. One step further would be to allow walk-through virtual tours on-line. Those tours represent the real world exhibition to a certain extent. Visitors at home can experience a guided tour as though they were at a museum. In order to make those 3D worlds as accessible as possible, the use of standard methods is recommended. This paper gives an overview of standards currently in use and their relevance in the presentation of cultural heritage. Also, one method is chosen for representing the digital content of a special exhibition at the Technical Museum Vienna. An important standard format for three-dimensional content on the Web used to be VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language). This has evolved into the XML based X3D. Another method of bringing three-dimensional content on the Web is Shockwave3D. These technologies are compared in terms of flexibility and usability. To allow a curator easy development of virtual tours, an application was developed to support the procedure. The development process will be outlined, as well as how a prototypic client is used to access virtual exhibitions. The client uses standardized methods for the rendering of the three-dimensional scenes and also allows for interactivity."

This paper describes and analyzes the approaches underlying the different projects and the resulting differences in user experience. This is done partly by comparing data from user feedback. Based on a preliminary survey, the projects seem to fall into rather distinct categories: projects that present the material in \"pure\" form, thus leaving interpretation to the users; projects that present the material together with context, in order to make it more intelligible to users not inherently familiar with the subject matter; and projects that develop the individual information snippets into coherent narratives, thus making it interesting to a wider audience. This paper analyses advantages and drawbacks of the specific solutions on a background of user reactions in order to glimpse a pattern in the interplay between the choices made and the groups of users that prefer each of the sites."

The main objective of the virtual exhibition is complementary to the current exhibition. Provide information, list of objects and operating proposal that could be difficult to develop in an exhibition in which dominates the environmental sense. The virtual exhibition offers information on all objects of the early twentieth century that form the collection of laboratory and interactive elements. It uses as a basis for interactive images of objects themselves, that the exhibition can not touch or return has to operate. Through a convenient menu, have been described one hundred and twenty laboratory apparatus that are grouped into: hydrostatic, electricity, mechanics, optics, acoustics and pressure. We have created twenty-five short interactive understand its operation. The creation of a virtual exhibition allows for a more comprehensive, getting that exposure reaches public could hardly visit."

But are heritage institutions capable of taking this road? This paper aims at unveiling the needs and views of Flemish heritage experts concerning the two major components of the Heritage 2.0 research project: on the one hand, the creation of a communication layer on top of existing databases, and on the other hand, the presentation of heritage by means of mobile technologies (for example, a PDA). Since mobile heritage presentation is still in its infancy in Flanders, we decided to extend these focus group conversations by means of some in-depth interviews with international experts. We asked them to reflect upon 5 central issues regarding mobile heritage presentation. In this paper we highlight some of the most interesting conclusions."

Before January of 2008, it primarily held ?user-generated content,? photographs and stories from individuals in practically every country on the planet. Pioneering a variety of ?Web 2.0? technologies like tagging, Flickr has grown into an enormous corpus of photography that reflects humanity over the last four years, and beyond. ?The Commons? is a program we've developed to introduce publicly-held photography collections into the mix. Releasing a pilot partnership with the Library of Congress Prints & Photographs Catalog has at once provided an interesting counterbalance to this ?user-generated? archive and also begun to test ideas around the knowledge, authority and participation of the general public. Primarily intended to increase access to the vast collections of photography held in libraries, archives and museums around the world, the program also seeks to gather additional context about objects in these collections, and potentially even feedback or be cross-referenced by those institutions participating. There are thousands of interested members of the general public already adding information and knowledge about the content released in the pilot program. This paper is intended to outline the progress of the pilot so far, and to provide information for interested parties about how to participate in the Commons on Flickr."

    "abstract": "Involving children in Cultural Heritage, in general, requires strong cooperation between cultural institutions and teachers. Cultural institutions ?own? the artifacts and the scientific knowledge; teachers are in charge of the learning process. Technology can help in a number of ways to achieve a more symbiotic approach: it can make the learning process more effective; it can contribute to the fun and the hype, and therefore provide additional motivation to kids; and finally, it can generate ?rewarding results? from an educational perspective. The project Milano Romana Tecnologica (i.e., Milan at the time of the Roman Empire presented through Technology), was carried out by a classroom of 24 pupils (K5) in Milan, Italy. Children combined several activities in a period of 2 months: they visited the Archeological Museum in town; they searched for additional material on the Internet or in the school library; they shot pictures or made drawings when they could not find the proper visual documentation; they creating narratives; they recorded MP3 audios?.and finally, they developed a ?multichannel? hyperstory on Roman Milan, using ?1001stories? (the instant multimedia engine that was presented at Museums and the Web 2007). The result is a pleasant and fresh interactive multimedia narrative which provides multiple reading paths and is delivered as Web Site, podcast and CD-ROM. A copy of the CD-ROM was given to the parents of each child. The children had a lot of fun. According to their teachers, they not only got acquainted with multimedia technology, but also (and above all) improved their knowledge and understanding of both Milan during the Roman period and more generally, Roman Civilization. Families were enthusiastic about the fact that their kids had done something previously considered beyond their capabilities (and they were also happy to receive the CD-ROM as a souvenir of that school year). The cultural institution (i.e., the Archeological Museum) was very happy to receive so much interest and attention."

    "abstract": "How would you piece together the culture web of the future? In the perfectly interoperable, automatically-joined world of 'Web 3.0', some think we need our content connected more closely, more intelligently, with more meaning. But, faced with the initial challenges of Web 2.0, is the UK museum and gallery sector now heading in the right direction strategically, technically and in terms of sustainability? Is the negligible engagement of UK museums with the new wave Web an indicator of more fundamental blockages to come? Can we cope with even bigger steps towards a more unified digital world, an Internet of things? Many people working deep in the digital cultural sector feel there's a growing gap between what's going on out there in the fertile land of Facebook, and what's going on in our arid world of collection descriptions, copyright conundrums and so on. A wish for more decisive, open-minded developmental connections recently led to the 2006/2007 Semantic Web Think Tank (SWTT) project, a UK research partnership between the Museums Computer Group, MDA, the V&A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, the 24 Hour Museum and collaborators in the academic world, such as Cambridge University, Leicester University and software sector groups like Box UK. The SWTT project pulled together experts from all sides, talking in six directed sessions which were recorded and published as papers on a blog and in a planned report. The big 'take home' from the SWTT project has not, in the end, been a demonstrator, mash-up or a software widget of some kind. It's the emergence of a suggested roadmap for the development of a joined-up digital cultural sector, to be revealed in more detail in a report published spring/summer 2008."

    "year": "2008",
    "abstract": "Over the last few years, digital content has gained importance in cultural heritage institutions. Video and picture material is being digitized in order to manage the large amount of content with ease. Digital data can be administered using databases that allow the addition of meta information as well as manipulation of certain media (e.g. dust and flicker reduction on historic film material). Digitized versions of film and audio documents and digital images of objects (paintings, statues, architecture ?) can also be used to attract a larger audience by making available previews of exhibitions on the Web. One step further would be to allow walk-through virtual tours on-line. Those tours represent the real world exhibition to a certain extent. Visitors at home can experience a guided tour as though they were at a museum. In order to make those 3D worlds as accessible as possible, the use of standard methods is recommended. This paper gives an overview of standards currently in use and their relevance in the presentation of cultural heritage. Also, one method is chosen for representing the digital content of a special exhibition at the Technical Museum Vienna. An important standard format for three-dimensional content on the Web used to be VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language). This has evolved into the XML based X3D. Another method of bringing three-dimensional content on the Web is Shockwave3D. These technologies are compared in terms of flexibility and usability. To allow a curator easy development of virtual tours, an application was developed to support the procedure. The development process will be outlined, as well as how a prototypic client is used to access virtual exhibitions. The client uses standardized methods for the rendering of the three-dimensional scenes and also allows for interactivity."

Free software now makes it possible for organisations within the heritage sector to produce multimedia guides without the expense of consultants and specialist companies. Case Studies of The Ruthin E-Trail and The Blaenavon E-Trail demonstrate innovative ways of delivering heritage information to a wide audience, while at the same time producing a pilot education project and encouraging tourism. From the outset this project adopted a multi-platform approach, using a variety of digital formats for deployment to a range of devices; MP3 audio tours for MP3 players, audio-visual tours for devices with video players, and GPS-enabled applications that deliver multi-media content."

    "abstract": "Any museum professional will tell you that collections are at the heart of what a museum is about. With collection sizes typically too large to have everything on display at once, museum Web sites have often been called upon to help provide greater access to museum objects. The approach, though, is typically one of depth rather than breadth, focusing on highlighted objects and curated themes. This can deliver great educational content - but how might you build a Web site to represent the collections of a museum as a whole? The paper sets out to answer this question by way of original research and experimentation on real data sets of museum objects, obtained from a number of UK museums by way of a Freedom of Information request. These data sources are roughly hewn together - a technical and semantic challenge that's briefly explained - to form a single, enormous database.The result is a prototype Web site employing a fresh approach to viewing museum collections on-line, eschewing details in favour of high-level overviews and visualisations, incorporating user annotations and revealing insights into the histories of museum collecting. The 'who', 'what', 'where' and 'whens' of objects are all examined in turn as axis for understanding and grouping collections, with the 'why' left open for interpretation and comments. Looking forward, the paper asks how museum objects might fit into a 'web of data', where collections from different museums can be compared with each other, and perhaps even with private and personal collections."

    "abstract": "In 2007 the Art Gallery of Ontario (http://www.ago.net) closed its doors temporarily to complete the renovation and installation of a new Frank Gehry-designed facility. In the months leading up to this closure, the Gallery experimented with different ways to keep people connected to the institution. One of the most high profile programs to emerge during this time was the exhibition In Your Face that began with a call for submission asking the public to send in postcard-sized portraits. The response to this project was unprecedented and resulted in the AGO receiving over 17,000 portraits that were initially presented within a gallery space normally reserved for blockbuster exhibitions. The success of this endeavor led the AGO to experiment with various on-line presentations of similar content that further demonstrated that museums can function as catalytic agents when open to experimenting with a combination of innovative programming and on-line access. The success of In Your Face also attracted the attention of the Portrait Gallery of Canada (http://www.portraits.gc.ca) , a public gallery without a permanent home, and resulted in a partnership that made it possible for the exhibition to be re-mounted in Ottawa, and made it accessible to a national audience. Tracing the evolution of In Your Face through its various forms of presentation and partnership, this paper examines issues of significance to museums and galleries as their relationship to the public is forced to evolve in response to changing circumstances, including those times when collections may be inaccessible and the building itself is offline."

Visitors' voices on exhibitions can be heard both on-site and on-line. This paper presents and compares interactive design pieces that intend to motivate visitors to participate in co-creating the message of the museum by leaving in-depth commentaries. Design options are chosen as parameters for comparison because they affect participation and therefore the museum visit experience. The design options relate to the theme chosen for participation and how openly this theme is presented, as well as the atmosphere of the piece, the input-output modalities, the on-site or on-floor configurations, the accessibility and the ties with the time of the visit and with the larger community. Designers geared towards creating or using tools that encourage participation must be aware that all design options modify responses. Comparing these projects is a way to point out how interactive pieces can affect visitors' participation in the museum and with it the experience of the visit."

    "abstract": "What is the Museum's role in giving voice to the objects it presents? A recent exhibition of Scandinavian artist Olafur Eliasson provided an opportunity to test one institution's internal tolerance for multi-vocal popular response. Eliasson explicitly states that his immersive environments are set-ups for engagement, and that the viewer completes the work. With that in mind, the SFMOMA Interactive Educational Technologies (IET) team produced an interactive kiosk / Web site that offered background commentary and footage of the artist discussing his philosophy and studio practice, but stopped short of describing individual works in detail. That role was left to the visitors, each of whom, it was theorized, would have a personal experience of the various works in the show. What would come of this kaleidoscopic perspective? There were technical as well as philosophical hurdles to overcome ? notably, mashing up a static Pachyderm presentation with a customized WordPress blog - but the emphasis in this paper will be on implications for interpretive practice, and the opportunity opened up by Web 2.0 technologies to a) get to know our visitors better, and b) come to know the artworks we display differently through the prism of visitor interpretations. What is lost by allowing the museum's message to become more \"diffuse?\" What are the limits of this democracy of voices? Are there specific strategies that elicit and give shape to more compelling content for readers, and greater insights for the visitors who contribute to the conversation? These and other issues that have arisen over the course of this first SFMOMA blog experiment - running from September 2007 through February 2008 - are discussed."

    "abstract": "Artists and master-printers have a long and rich tradition of collaboration and it is instructive to consider the Internet through the prism of printmaking. The art and craft of printmaking affords a collapsing of barriers not only between production and distribution but also between the traditional role of \"craftsman\" and artist. We will always have master printers and continue to be the better for it, but no one begrudges an artist the effort of learning the same skills solely in the pursuit of their own work. Computer programming is the acid bath of the Internet. In its purest form it can be harsh and threatening but it is also the vehicle that allows a cold sheet of metal becomes a lush and absorbent canvas. All artists operate in the space between being experts in the mechanics of their medium -- few printmakers are also chemical engineers -- and merely consumers of prefabricated tools. We are still a long way from finding the craft in computers which isn't to say that we all need to learn programming; only that we should afford the practice more attention in order to give artists the tools to explore and shape a networked world and to bend those tools in to newer one just as artists began doing with photography two hundred years ago. By encouraging the same latitude of understanding to the gory details that govern the Internet we explode the bottleneck that has distorted a vast horizon of creation, collaboration and above all mystery. To borrow William Gibson's phrase, to help artists \"find their own use for things.\""

    "abstract": "At a time when both museum visitation and art-based, K-12 curricula are on the decline, some art museums are turning to new and innovative storytelling programs to engage visitors and instruct students. Combining visitor-created narratives and literacy education programs, museums are enticing visitors to experience their collections through the power of storytelling. This paper will explore a variety of programs, from larger-scale literacy program partnerships between public school systems and prominent art museums to smaller, more unconventional programs at a series of other museums. While some of these programs are more conventional in nature, a few employ both on-line and handheld technologies to facilitate visitor storytelling, enriching and extending their museum experiences. Allowed to create and share their own stories alongside the authoritative museum narrative, visitors come away with a more vibrant, engaging and inspired experience. In greater depth, we will explore the case study of the Art of Storytelling project at the Delaware Art Museum. Our evaluation addresses both the impacts of both the original storytelling experience on the participants, and the educational activity on students, the results of which are further explored in this paper."

Currently, the demonstrator hosts four thesauri, namely the three Getty vocabularies, i.e., the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), the Union List of Artists Names (ULAN) and the Thesaurus of Geographical Names (TGN), as well as the lexical resource WordNet, version 2.0. The Getty thesauri were converted from their original XML format into an RDF/OWL representation. The RDF/OWL conversion of WordNet is documented in a publication of the W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group The architecture is independent of the particular thesauri being used. We are currently in the process of adding the Dutch version of AAT, amongst others to support a multi-lingual interface. Integration of other (multi-lingual) thesauri is planned.Using multiple vocabularies is a baseline principle of our approach. It also raises the issue of alignment between the vocabularies. Basically, semantic interoperability will increase when semantic links between vocabularies are added. Within the Getty vocabularies one set of links is systematically maintained: places in ULAN (e.g., place of birth of an artist) refer to terms in TGN. Within the project we are Adding additional sets of links. One example is links between art styles in AAT (e.g. \"Impressionism\") and artists in ULAN (e.g., \"Monet\"). The project has worked on deriving these semi-automatically from texts on art history.For annotation and search purposes the tool provides the user with a description template derived from the VRA 3.0 Core Categories. The VRA template is defined as a specialization of the Dublin Core set of metadata elements, tailored to the needs of art images. The VRA Core Categories follow the \"dumb-down\" principle, i.e., a tool can interpret the VRA data elements as Dublin Core data elements.In principle, every web resource with a URI can be included and annotated in the virtual collection of our demonstrator. As a test set of data we have included three web collections: (i) the Artchive collection (http://www.artchive.com/, 4,000 images of paintings), (ii) the ARIA collection (http://rijksmuseum.nl/aria/, images of some 750 master pieces), and (iii) the RMV collection (http://www.rmv.nl, 80,000 images of ethnographic objects). Parsing techniques were used to convert the original textual metadata into semantic metadata (i.e. entries in the vocabulary). We are incorporating m re collections."

The surroundings are not those in which users might normally use the Web site: this user is working alone. So what happens when a testing session is carried out in a classroom with a large number of people? Taking user testing into the user environment rather than bringing the user into closed surroundings allows spatial, emotional, and social issues to influence the way the Web site is used."

    "abstract": "The deployment of virtual expositions of accurately rendered, high quality 3D models over the Web is a common practice today in many cases of cultural heritage and arts initiatives. In the specific case of virtual museums, where the nature of the content opens possibilities that go beyond those of a single, localised physical exhibition, the availability of Web-ready content related to the project's collection of digital models becomes almost mandatory. Although desirable, presenting interactive content over the Web is not a simple task, and a large part of the current generation of 3D-Web technology, being tailor-made mainly for graphics-only applications, often imposes severe limitations on the possibilities for user interaction.As a result of these technological limitations, the user expects of the virtual exhibition, and very little has been explored so far about the potential benefits that the sense of touch could introduce in the interaction paradigm. We report here the results obtained from mixing high performance 3D graphics with haptic interaction in the context of several museum installations, as well as presenting a new generation of Web technology that makes it possible to deploy this type of content on the Web."

The project allows participants to report any bird they see using one of several data-collecting protocols. Participants and other visitors to the site also view and manipulate data submitted to the eBird database to answer their own questions about bird distribution and abundance. Responses to these visitor queries can be viewed in the form of graphs and histograms as well as on maps. We were interested in learning about how eBird participants use these data tools, and how participating in the project might affect their thinking about the concept of conservation. The eBird New User Survey employed standard survey questions combined with exploration of live data and an on-line version of the Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM) technique to address these questions. Nearly ninety percent of eBird participants used the data tools to answer at least one type of question, and most participants used the tools in multiple ways.Participant understanding of the resulting data varied. Most understood how to use map and frequency data; however, many were confused by other data types available. The on-line PMM protocol generated extremely rich data to which a typical coding framework could be successfully applied; however, respondents were unlikely to make changes to their PMM statements, making it difficult to assess changes in perspectives on conservation related to participation in the eBird project."

Despite its great potential, however, there is still very little evidence that bookmarking actually works in the terms envisaged by its promoters. To consider this question, we will analyze examples of different on-line and on-site applications, accompanied by a detailed investigation of usage statistics and evaluation results carried out in part by the authors and in part by museums. We will consider case studies from Tate Modern, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Museum of Science in Boston, and The Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, among others."

    "abstract": "The importance of accessibility to museum Web sites is well-understood. The W3C WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) guidelines provide a well-recognized and widely accepted approach which can help to ensure that Web resources can be accessed by people with disabilities.However experiences in use of WAI guidelines since they were released in 1999 is leading organisations to question their effectiveness. It has been argued that the low level of conformance with WAI guidelines is due not to a lack of willingness to provide accessible Web sites but to a realisation that the guidelines have their limitations and the WAI model has its flaws.Such limitations are becoming even more apparent in a Web 2.0 environment which is providing a range of use case scenarios which were not envisaged when the WAI guidelines were first released.A new set of guidelines are being developed (WCAG 2.0) which seek to address some of the limitations of the existing guidelines. However, as has been pointed out by Joe Clarke in his \"To Hell With WCAG 2.0\" article, these guidelines themselves fail to address many of the concerns which have been raised, and have failed to acknowledge that other approaches to accessibility may provide legitimate ways of addressing the challenges of providing accessible solutions. Such limitations, however, do not mean that the guidelines need to be abandoned. Rather there is a need to make use of those guidelines which have been proven to be effective. In addition there is a need to recognize that different contexts may require different solutions.Such limitations, however, do not mean that the guidelines need to be abandoned. Rather there is a need to make use of those guidelines which have been proven to be effective. In addition there is a need to recognize that different contexts may require different solutions.In this Professional Forum the facilitators will review the limitations of the WAI approach to accessibility and describe a model for accessibility which emphasizes the importance of addressing user needs holistically rather than simply applying a checklist. An example of a how this approach can be used in a specific context will be given.The key aspect of the professional forum will be the engagement with the audience. Members of the audience will be invited to: Contribute their experiences in providing accessible Web sites and difficulties which may have been experienced. Provide feedback on the holistic model. Generate the basis of a roadmap to take forward an approach to accessibility which is suited for the requirements of the museum's community. Form a working group that takes these issues forward in their respective organisations and countries."

    "year": "2007",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the extent to which user-centred design can be applied to the development of effective learning experiences in museum Web sites. If it is good practice to formatively test Web designs during development to ensure they deliver what they are supposed to, then arguably this applies as much to learning activities as well. But we cannot test predictively if we don't know what the design is intended to achieve. So if the purpose is to support and encourage learning, then specifying learning outcomes is essential. While some authors argue that specific learning outcomes are undesirable because they limit the usability or relevance of an activity, this paper suggests that they are essential because they offer a benchmark against which designers, Museum directors and funding bodies can measure how effective the investment of time, money, and imagination has been. Prediction is not the same as prescription, and well designed learning activities based on predictive learning outcomes need not result in learning activities that proscribe alternative uses."

    "abstract": "How we think about our users shapes the Web spaces we create and their purpose, design, content and functionality. The ways we think about users are an implicit but often unexplored part of planning and managing museum Web sites. However, perhaps it is time we examined these assumptions more closely and directly.Recent research presented at this conference identified a number of problem areas in defining and categorising users of digital cultural content (Dawson et al. 2004). The field struggles to find a consistent language for describing its objectives, markets, customers, impacts and outcomes. In the absence of an e-commerce bottom line and with often ambitious social agendas for education and access, museum Web sites suffer from a lack of tangible success measures.Yet at the heart of these frustrations seems to be our confused and conflicting models of the museum Web site user. How can we effectively design, promote and evaluate on-line content without clear and demonstrable models of user needs, motivations, behaviours and satisfactions? Part of the problem appears to be that concepts and constructs borrowed from museum visitor studies and consumer product marketing may be inappropriate to the on-line information space in which museum Web sites exist. As the Web evolves into a more participative space (Carey, Jeffrey 2006) and user goals and behaviours become more complex, the inadequacy of existing approaches looms as an even greater problem.This paper addresses these issues by proposing a new, more holistic model for conceptualising museum Web site use. It then discusses the application of the model from the practical perspective of site planning and design, using the example of a site redevelopment project currently underway at Museum Victoria, a major natural and social history museum in Melbourne, Australia."

With an attractive environment and visual emphasis, the new Web site can communicate better with its target public and better represents the exhibition. The idea was to build an environment that looks more like a visual experience than an informational Web site with textual content. The information levels were restructured and the arrangement of the information was reorganized.The new Web site has two separate areas. The first is for communication of the project itself, NanoAventura, where there is a virtual map tour with the main information on the exhibition (infographic). The second area is designed to communicate nanoscience and nanotechnology to the general public. This area was projected as a blog to allow the exchange of information between the public and the NanoAventura staff. This blog can be personalized by every user as a powerful tool for specific searches. Also included were three games designed to extend the NanoAventura experience."

For digital preservation we require assurances of fixity, as well as the capture of significant metadata about objects, their contributors and creators (where possible), and about the relationships between complex objects. In this project, we made good progress towards these goals and made a major step forward in our goal of becoming and exemplifying the \"Archive for the 21st century.\""

All cataloguing, search, and administrative functions are accessible via the Internet, using standard Web browsers, and cataloguing and on-line access to collections information is easy, efficient, and inexpensive.OpenCollection is, to the Museum's knowledge, the first software of its kind. It represents an alternative to the expensive proprietary collections management software used by some of the country's largest museums and the ad-hoc collection databases that other institutions construct in lieu of appropriate software.OpenCollection was developed for the Museum's own use between 2004-2006 with support provided by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and with the intention that the software would ultimately be made available to museums, libraries, and archives. The software's programmer, independent developer Seth Kaufman, is committed to the software's distribution in this manner.In early 2007, the Museum will make OpenCollection and its source code freely available under the GNU Public License (the image viewer is now available under the same license). This is being done with the full participation and involvement of independent software developer Seth Kaufman, the author of much of the software's underlying code."

    "abstract": "For the creative museum professional, innovative technologies can be an irresistible Pandora's Box. Enormous possibilities await -- possibilities to connect with disaffected audiences, to make dynamic, engaging programs, to suffer software incompatibles, costly contractor support, and potential obsolescence. Personal technology devices (PDAs, iPods, cell phones/smart phones) solve several problems by shifting the burden of maintenance to the user and eliminating distribution and collection of museum-loaned devices.Still not a true convergence device, cell phones have rapidly moved towards the vision of being the \"third screen.\" Despite some technical liabilities, they are poised to be the most pertinent technology device, primarily because visitors generally have their phones with them during their visit. However, despite the pervasiveness of such phones, early studies have revealed that when presented with phone-based exhibition enhancements, visitors are quite hesitant to use them. Yet visitors who do make use of cell phone capabilities appear to have more in-depth experiences and longer stay time.Is hesitancy to use the phone capabilities in exhibitions a true trend? And if so, what is the nature of that hesitancy? We have been thinking hard about these questions in the course of working on the NSF-funded SNSE (Science Now, Science Everywhere) project.In SNSE, the Liberty Science Center is pushing the possibilities of the visitor/phone interaction beyond tours. This paper will explore visitor use of cell phones as exhibition resources from the viewpoint of potential challenges to visitor adoption and the emerging benefits of such technology. The author will examine the preliminary data and the implications from both theoretical and practical interpretations."

This Web site offers a framework to explore key works from the Whitney's collection of twentieth and twenty-first century American art, and a variety of tools through which to interact with and explore these images as primary resources for teaching and learning.A key objective in developing this educational Web site was to provide strategies and tools that assist teachers in all subject areas to expand their use and integration of images in the classroom, and to make concrete connections between the Whitney's resources, current pedagogical directives, and the process by which they design curriculum. The creation of the Learning@Whitney site also afforded a unique opportunity to rethink the ways in which images might be incorporated as elements of learning and teaching experiences. The culmination of this inquiry process led to the design and development of an interactive tool called Collect Art. With this tool, site users create collections of Whitney images as well as complementary slide shows that can include text, sounds, Compare and Contrast pairings, and the ability to then share their work with others.This mini-workshop will examine the development and integration of the Collect Art tool into the larger Learning@Whitney site design from a practical, pedagogical, and technical perspective. In addition to theoretical perspectives, examples of how teachers have successfully integrated their collections into specific classroom lessons and activities will be shown."

It was developed to provide the advantages of advanced wavelet compression to institutions that have digital archives while eliminating the concerns associated with proprietary compression and file formats. JPEG2000 allows cultural institutions such as Library and Archives Canada to preserve culturally significant digital objects using lossless compression while providing higher performance and new features not possible in other file format types. This paper discusses the initiation, planning and implementation of the pilot project for JPEG2000 at Library and Archives Canada. What is the scope of the pilot project? If we are to implement JPEG2000 as a multiphased project, what are the implementation stages? If we convert images to the new format, how many and what type of images are converted? What are the higher performance and new features of JPEG2000 that are not possible with other file formats types? What are the risks assumed with implementing JPEG2000 in a cultural institution? What are the significant advantages of using this image compression standard for the Web? How cost effective and relevant is JPEG2000 to museums?"

Videos, audio broadcasts and interactive technologies are tools that museums can now use to engage and communicate with their audiences. Media broadcast via the Internet can give even the smallest, most remote museum a global presence. While there is little doubt that digital media have the power to transform institutions, for many museum professionals the practical use of these emerging technologies remains elusive. The new field of digital media is complex, fast-paced and often poorly defined. There are many barriers keeping museums (both large and small) from venturing to this exciting new frontier. So how can museum professionals overcome these barriers and help their museums stay up to speed? How can an advocate of technology affect institutional change? This paper provides answers to these questions and offers clever, practical and inexpensive ways to develop, create and distribute digital media."

It is designed to host museums of various disciplines to distribute their in-house-produced educational video programs for audiences of K to 12 Schools, Universities, adults, and children in hospitals with long-term illness who require educational and intellectual entertainment programs without going outside.Prof. Iwabuchi's firm belief is that more diversified use of museum content will be a great service to those mentioned above, and with that in mind, her team created a video content distribution platform that is easy to manage for the administrator and graphically attractive for the audience.Since its introduction in May 2006, there have been some alterations done to the original platform. New features have been added since October, 2006: Pod-casting, rating by the audience, sorting by categories, and search tags. The visual appearance is also slightly different now as the current platform is not in multi channels, but in a single channel with categories and sort-by search tags.

Similarly, many \"open source\" learning and education portals are rapidly growing into major free global lifelong learning resources. At the same time, U.S. student achievement in science in middle and high schools continues to be lag far behind that of students in many developed countries, and many American K-8 science teachers still lack B.A. degrees in science or adequate ongoing professional development in both science content and pedagogy. A huge and growing gap thus exists between the vast, freely available wealth of museum and other informal science Web learning resources and teachers."

However, experience has shown that the use of open standards is not always straightforward and that open standards do not always succeed in gaining acceptance in the market place.This should not mean an abandonment of a commitment to seek to exploit the benefits of open standards. Rather, there is a need to be honest about possible limitations and to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility within the approaches taken in development work to accommodate limitations and deficiencies.This paper outlines a contextual model for the selection and use of open standards, developed initially to support JISC."

T2ST is an evocative environmentally-scaled artwork designed to convey the notion that science and technology is exciting, dynamic and current. To that end, Onomy Labs, working with Anne Balsamo (University of Southern California Institute for Multimedia Literacy), Jon Winet (University of Iowa Experimental Writing Wing) and John Randolph (Randolph Designs) are creating a large-scale interactive mobile that includes three thematically-relevant floating shapes and other dynamic displays that visitors will interact with from the different levels of the building structure. The T2ST design includes twenty-seven active surfaces that display information from RSS feeds from trusted science and technology sources on the Web. In this way, T2ST provides an automatic and evergreen source of science and technology news, much as Times Square does for the topics of financial news, current events, and advertising. The installation demonstrates a new way to bring Web-based content not only into the public area of the museum but also out again via SMS and MMS subscriptions of thematically relevant content. To facilitate such an operation, Onomy Labs developed a suite of tools for directing automated searches of the Web and to manage input from staff and members of the public. This paper describes the architecture and preliminary use of this suite of tools in using the Web as an evergreen information source live and in color on the museum floor and in visitors."

A mobile phone can provide live broadcasting capabilities for museum galleries, school classrooms, community centers and even fossil sites. With the right kind of equipment; namely, an audio/video port on the phone, this type of broadcasting can be simple to set up, dynamic and spontaneous. Common concerns regarding resolution quality and phone charge expense are not onerous, compared to other modes of information delivery. The image is good enough to allow people to communicate clearly. Also, communication charges are a pittance compared to the cost of transporting a lecturer to a venue. Phone broadcasting is an opportunity for interactive activity that allows different groups to defy spatial constraints. We provide details on several recent telecommunication experiences with links in Japan and abroad."

The superimposed images are interactive 3D computer graphics with mixed reality technology. Additional information, such as the names of the bones, can be displayed on the screen, and an audio guide can be played from the handheld PC. Users can change the skin texture and the skin color of the dinosaurs right in front of the skeletons in the museum gallery. Thinking about and choosing the skin images will enable children to think more scientifically about dinosaurs. We are currently developing a computer program that enables users to draw their own dinosaurs and save them on the Web. Users can then view their creations with mixed reality technology.

Despite the absence of established paradigms, a number of academic institutions are developing programs in this area. At this critical juncture, when skills and processes are being codified for the first time in academic curricula, the input of professional practitioners is desperately needed. This paper and accompanying forum are an open invitation to the museum multimedia community to contribute their insights. Key issues will be discussed in the context of a conceptual model and concrete examples. The model is based on three years of student feedback at the University of Lugano. It addresses three questions: What should students know? How should they learn it? Who should teach it? Meaningful dialogue between the academic and professional communities is the only way to bridge the gap between theoretical and applied knowledge. This is especially true in a multidisciplinary field like cultural heritage multimedia where there is no consensus about the ideal path to professional qualification. Museum professionals, your future colleagues need your help. How can educators ensure that graduates will be able to operate creatively and effectively in the professional environment? And how can they support you in pushing our field in challenging and exciting directions? Join us in exploring these important questions."

How can a museum make its site relevant and, dare we say, compelling, to these diverse audiences? At the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) we have taken a user-centered approach to finding an answer. In spring 2006, we partnered with Hot Studio, a leading user-centered design firm, to conduct an intensive research and strategy project as part of a larger Web site redesign initiative. Our project employed a variety of research methods that are considered best practices in user-centered design, including an extensive on-line survey of site visitors, live interviews with site users and SFMOMA staff, and a think tank with representatives from national and international institutions. This paper, co-authored by SFMOMA and Hot Studio, presents an overview of user-centered design research tools and methods. We present the findings from our own research, and we demonstrate how these findings led to tangible design features in the plans for our new site. Readers will get the benefit of our research findings and come away with a deeper understanding of the value of research as well as some fresh ideas on how to incorporate user-centered design techniques into their own work."

One of the scientific aims of absalon.nu has been to examine the extent to which already existing data could be mined in order to create the core of a system for presentation on the web for the general public. Large sums are invested in procuring the data in the exiting databases of the three institutions and it is therefore of obvious interest to be able to exploit this investment in the best possible way. Although it is a commonplace that data made for internal purposes are seldom suited for use by the general public it is on the other hand the same types of information that are interesting in both cases. The crucial question is therefore how and to which extent these data can be used in a meaningful and user friendly way, and what type of transformation, ad additions are necessary for their use in a broader context. Apart from more ordinary additions to data Absalon.nu has utilized two strategies. First of all graphically: We intend to display related information using mindmaps and other graphical tools. In this way users will get information on the classifications etc. that are normally presupposed in users of the internal databases. Secondly Absalon.nu intends to create parts of these relationships, through automated linguistic analysis of the conternt, taking into account not only the individual lemma (root-form of word) but also the meaning of the sentences based on a grammatical analysis. After a brief presentation of absalon.nu, this demonstration addresses the problems mentioned above based on the concrete findings of Abslon.nu with outlook to other similar endeavors and tries to draw some more general."

Its framework goal is to extend the relationship between industrial heritage, memory and ICTs, placing special emphasis on formal and non-formal education, teaching and learning, and in particular the potential of ICTs. Specifically, the project has as its main goals preserving the industrial heritage of Catalonia; the use of industrial heritage as a learning goal; and the development of virtual (on-line/on site) resources for industrial heritage management, documentation and dissemination. Complementary goals are to analyse virtual resources and tools that can be used in transversal areas of knowledge like heritage; and to investigate the design of learning activities that use these resources. From this perspective, we consider it essential to conduct a theoretical and methodological review of the current state of knowledge in this area, and the development of case studies and specific products, including an evaluation process. Taking as a base the different experiences carried out in this area, we intend to confirm that the ICT resources in the Broadcasting and Didactics of Heritage can become an essential factor for formal education. Bearing in mind the above, this proposed project relates to the research, analysis and design of tools channeled particularly to promote this new interdisciplinary area of knowledge."

Traditionally, some of the most captivating and educational Web sites were created by museums to accompany brick and mortar exhibitions. Often the content that was laboriously collected for these exhibitions would be repurposed for the Web. In this session, we present three projects created specifically for a Web delivery: Ripples of Genocide, Life After the Holocaust, and Yearbook 2006. Two of these projects, Ripples of Genocide and Life After the Holocaust, created by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in conjunction with bluecadet interactive, were nominees for best Narrative Web site at this year's Flashforward conference. Yearbook 2006 is a not-for-profit interactive documentary on a senior class displaced by Hurricane Katrina; it was hailed by CNN's Technology correspondent Regina Lewis as \"one of the best of the best.\" These sites employ cutting edge approaches to non-linear storytelling, borrowing techniques and best practices from print and exhibition design as well as video and audio production. This paper will present both the technical and narrative challenges in telling a complex story on the Web and how these challenges can be met. We will discuss the history of the interactive narrative as well as a vision for the future of the medium."

The consequence of the above is that a new approach must be taken: \"instant multimedia\" (analogous to \"instant books\") means that in a short span of time, with little budget a good quality multimedia application must be produced, possibly involving several technological channels (from Web to mobile and iPOD).Low budget means that the production can be repeated often; short span of time means that opportunities can be taken when they appear; good quality means that the impact upon users is granted.Instant multimedia imply an \"instant design method\" (design must be accomplished fast), an \"instant workflow\" (every one in the team should know what to do), and an \"instant technology\" (fast and easy to use and reliable).In this mini-workshop we will:"

The paper places the use of such dynamic 'labelling' in the longer historical context of museum interpretation and the relationship between museums' on-site and on-line channels. It considers the findings of both visitor observation and the impact of different 'generators' (authors) and 'triggers' (events) of the labels' live content.

    "abstract": "\"I believe the earth travels around the sun.\" Today we can say this with collective confidence, but four hundred years ago, Galileo was tried and convicted for this statement. Seeking an audience for his then-radical ideas, Galileo authored a book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, intended for the public as well as his peers. It reads as a conversation between two philosophers, allowing the reader to be a fly on the wall of scientific discourse. If Galileo were alive today, he'd probably have a blog. What better way to reach the masses? Touted as the great equalizing platform of information, the Web's multiplicity of voices destabilizes authority, yet this destabilization cuts both ways. On the Web, we find true alongside false, valid amid invalid, fact next to fiction. The abundance of information there is a dubious feast, leaving users with the important responsibility of deciding what to believe and what not to believe. Knowledge construction is the heart of the Exploratorium's latest project, called Evidence. The project probes the foundations of science in addressing one simple question: How do we know what we know? How do we choose what to believe? My Evidence is an online application developed for the Evidence project intended to help online users to better understand their own belief systems and processes of knowledge construction, as well as those of their peers. My Evidence begins by posing a series of statements on screen, such as, \"I believe the world is spinning.\" A user chooses from among these and proceeds to create their evidence map, a visual tool that helps a user categorize their knowledge according to how it was acquired. As a user enters more and more data, patterns in their growing evidence map give insights into what is personally salient to them in their own knowledge construction. My Evidence also allows users to compare their evidence maps to other users' maps. The purpose of this mini workshop is to take a closer look at how the Exploratorium developed this online application from its conceptual inception to its technical deployment. We will focus on online learning using Web 2.0 applications and the various pitfalls that accompany this lofty goal. Workshop participants will: 1) find out how we tested this with users during the development process, and what we did as a result of their feedback; 2) participate in a discussion about how to develop interactive offerings about abstract ideas; and 3) have the opportunity to construct, share, and save their own maps in My Evidence."

Findings are presented from the 2006 Randi Korn & Associates evaluation of interpretive media used in the Matthew Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT exhibition, which included audio tours in three formats, an exhibition brochure, and an in-gallery 'Learning Lounge' with video, multimedia kiosk, books, and wall graphics. The device-independent audio tour was the result of a first-of-its-kind collaboration between SFMOMA, Antenna Audio, and Guide by Cell in which the same audio content (developed by Antenna) was presented on Antenna's Gallery Xplorer, available at no additional cost with the Museum's permanent collection tour; as a free podcast or download from the Museum's Web site; and finally, for those who had arrived in the disorienting landscape of Barney's sculptures without prior preparation, via just-in-time phone calls to Guide by Cell's server. The results of the Randi Korn study are detailed and augmented by statistics on usage patterns for the Barney Learning Lounge, which mixed analog and digital resources. The conclusion summarizes implications of this research for museum interpretive strategies moving forward."

    "abstract": "In creating educational experiences, developers often target audience segments based on demographic groups. However, we all know that people vary in other ways; one size does not fit all. This paper presents results from a research study funded by the National Science Foundation that explores the effects of three possible influences (learning style, age, and gender) on user preferences for computer-based educational activities. Using David Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb, 1984) as a lens, we examined on-line learners' preferences for, and responses to, different types of activities ranging from deductive puzzles to open-ended design. Building on prior work presented at Museums & the Web (Schaller et al., 2002, 2005), we found that learning style does influence an individual's preferences for learning activities, particularly among adults. For example, adult social learners prefer role-play activities while intellectual learners prefer reference-style presentations. The relationship between learning styles and these preferences is stronger in adults, with adults showing more learning style-based preferences. On the other hand, among children ages 10-13 (middle school), the perceived play value of an activity has the strongest influence. While adults agree with children's play ratings, play value is not a primary consideration for adults. Age is more influential than gender in affecting activity preferences. Children prefer structured activities like Role-Play and Design. Adults prefer Interactive Reference and Puzzle-Mystery."

    "abstract": "Before describing our vision for a distributed service oriented museum Web, we assess the projects nexhibition (An On-line Exhibition tool), steve.museum (An Artwork tagging tool), Pachyderm (an open source museum presentation manager) and other open source products of interest to museums. At first sight, one might choose to see these as distinct, stand-alone products that require some investment to utilise effectively. We argue the case for breaking down these tools into their constituents and exposing their functionality through a distributed API such as SOAP. The paper explores how previously monolithic systems can instead be seen as re-usable components. Such services may include calendaring event programming/publishing; collections management systems; the tagging and analysis tools of steve; and the on-line exhibition generating tools of nexhibition and Pachyderm. This model empowers Web developers with the services to construct a rich set of functionality without necessarily having to learn how to implement these services in-house. We envisage a service market whereby vendors will offer out services such as those discussed. Museums will be able to pick and choose the services and offerings and may even choose to host services themselves. This will consolidate running costs, and increase the available range of services, and ensure the effective utilisation of I.T. Infrastructure by museums."

    "abstract": "While the emergence of Web 2.0 offers many exciting opportunities for museums to engage with new and diverse audiences, the reality is that many small and medium museums struggle to maintain even an elementary level of presence on the Web. They face multiple barriers: an absence of suitably skilled staff, limited financial and technical resources, and sometimes even a lack of access to reliable broadband internet services. How can smaller museums and cultural heritage organisations be empowered to develop high quality content and to participate in the on-line environment in ways which are meaningful to them and their target audiences? This paper shows how the needs of smaller museums to reach new audiences can be met through a collaborative, democratic model conceived around the notion of a Web portal. Collections Australia Network (CAN) -- a redevelopment of Australian Museums and Galleries On-line (AMOL) -- uses open source software solutions to provide a range of on-line tools that facilitate the creation of high quality, customizable, easily updated content by smaller museums for publication through the CAN Web portal. This paper demonstrates how the opportunities presented by Web 2.0 have been utilised by CAN to provide the means and context for smaller museums to make their content as discoverable to audiences as that from larger, better resourced museums."

Although VTS's facilitation strategy is designed for face-to-face instruction in the classroom, we asked the question, \"Can these same strategies be used to create an educational Web site for student learners?\" Three University of Chicago organizations, Chicago WebDocent, the eCUIP Digital Library, and the Oriental Institute Museum, set out to do just that.Informed by VTS and funded by a National Leadership Grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services, the partners set out to build an educational Web site for teaching and learning about the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia -- today's Iraq. Called Ancient Mesopotamia: This History, Our History, our project's intent was to build a site that empowered students to learn about this ancient culture by using virtual images of artifacts in two ways: in a group setting with a teacher as guide, and independently. The challenge was to build a Web site that engages students while allowing them to learn in both instructional settings and to transfer the tenets of VTS from a traditional teacher-led instructional setting to a virtual, student-driven learning environment. The result is a Web site with three major components: a Learning Collection of teacher-selected artifacts from the Oriental Institute Museum's Mesopotamian gallery; an interactive archaeological dig called."

On-line collaboration tools -- such as those for blogging, podcasting and image sharing -- are transforming museum visitors into active on-line contributors. When empowered to construct their own narratives in response to museum exhibits, visitors establish new connections to the exhibit content. Beyond expected content synthesis, these immersive activities stimulate learning in the affective domain. The participation in collaborative narrative activities engenders creative, independent analysis, promoting learner self-efficacy and a personal connection with exhibit subject matter that is unparalleled in more traditional and passive approaches. Both this kind of participatory storytelling and the educational impact of adopting a collaborative framework are presented through two case studies -- The Franklin Remixed and The Art of Storytelling.Engaged with in this immersive way, museum artifacts become rich sources of innovation and personal growth. Follow-up studies are indicated to examine the impact of creative \"Remixes\" on self-efficacy and innovative thinking skills."

I report results from several recent trials in which visitors used mobile devices to collaboratively create, edit and share trails. Visitors included 9- to 10-year-olds, as well as adults, studying the subject of horticulture in a botanic garden or relating artworks to personal experience in art museums. The overall goal is to find the appropriate levels of structure, support and focus for school visits as well as for casual visitors. Findings so far indicate that a narrow subject focus and a manageable amount of data capture are appropriate in most cases. Audio has proven the most important mode for communication and interpretation. Voice recording not only is easier and faster than entering text, but also enables visitors who may have writing difficulties. Audio is particularly effective when used collaboratively -- for example, when two people have a conversation or share their impressions while in front of the artifact or exhibit of interest."

    "abstract": "We know they're keen to work with museums, so why don't more schools participate successfully in collaborative on-line museum projects and why aren't more museums encouraging this kind of collaborative venture? This paper will examine the relationship between schools and museums with regard to e-learning, focusing on a small but increasing number of collaborative projects that have schools working together, learning from each other, or sharing multiple perspectives via a museum web site. Schools are ideal audiences for collaborative projects, and have become accustomed to taking part in in-gallery museum events and projects that involve multiple contributors. When moving towards a similar collaborative approach to on-line learning, though, the risks of a project failing become much greater. Although collaborative on-line projects have the potential to be incredibly rewarding, they are also challenging to manage: any ICT undertaking which relies on the ability and willingness of the participating schools or pupils to communicate with each other online will be at risk of losing participants through situations such as difficulties working with technology, varying levels of familiarity with ICT, changes in scheduling, decreased motivation due to lack of face-to-face contact, and other technical and personal elements that prevent participants from communicating with each other. The paper will examine recent examples of school-based museum e-learning projects, including Tate's 'Our Picture of Britain' collaborative project (http://www.tate.org.uk/learning/apictureofbritain/ourpic) and the schools contributions section now being created as part of the Moving Here website (http://www.movinghere.org.uk). It will compare these on-line resources to successful in-gallery projects such as the National Gallery's 'Take One Picture' schools programme (http://www.takeonepicture.org). The paper will consider the expectations and challenges associated with online collaborative ventures (drawing on perspectives from museum, educational, and socio-cultural theories), examine the issues surrounding the use of technology to encourage multiple voices and interpretations, and suggest how this knowledge might help museums to encourage and develop successful on-line collaborative projects for schools."

    "year": "2006",
    "abstract": "There has been significant debate over the last decade concerning the comparative merits of the virtual and physical offers within museums. Both have been treated as relative silos, and are often developed by separate teams who have little contact or overlap. Museums have been slow to recognise the full potential of integrating these two key areas and the value this would bring to the visitor experience. In order to extend and evolve their relationship with visitors, museums need to develop a holistic view of the audience journey across both the physical and virtual spheres. New media offers opportunities to engage the visitor within both the virtual and physical museums. It can continue visitors' experience beyond the walls of a museum and create a 'virtuous circle' between the virtual and physical space. Visitors are inspired on-line to visit the museum, while within the museum access to a variety of media channels (PDAs, mobiles, kiosks) encourages visitors to extend the journey by book-marking, voting and sending links of relevant information home. The museum experience is therefore personalized and can be explored by visitors in their own time and to the degree that they wish. However, in order to achieve this, museums must strategically implement this concept, considering multiple platforms and delivery channels when developing content and looking for opportunities for cross-fertilization where possible. A review of recent projects that the Natural History Museum, London, UK, has developed highlights some of the issues that arise as museums begin to implement the strategy of a virtuous circle, and indicates some of the research, resource and infrastructure issues that need to be addressed if it is to be successful."

Teenagers are the ones establishing the rules of this new mobile culture ad hoc. To them, the mobile phone is not a device for making phone calls, but rather, a 'lifeline' to the social network and an instrument for coordinating their everyday life. Can this tool, that has seemingly ensconced itself into youth culture, become a tool for informal science learning? This paper will summarize findings that have been collected as part of the Science Now, Science Everywhere (SNSE) project started by Liberty Science Center. SNSE is a recent technology initative by the Center that aims to explore the unique educational opportunities that are possible when visitors use their mobile phones as tools for learning in informal science education. Coupled with industry research from the technology and museum sectors, project research to date demonstrates an untapped area of educational opportunity that could be used to engage teens in science. Liberty Science Center believes that science centers can engage the teenage audience by extending the learning experience beyond hands-on interactives to mobile phones."

    "abstract": "This paper identifies two opposing factors within the overall trend towards increased accessibility of museum collections on the Web: the need to make museum Web sites more attractive to non-traditional audiences and the need to ensure that accessibility is maximised for those with disabilities. The rapidly increasing availability of broadband creates opportunities for museums to create rich multimedia Web sites that can attract much wider audiences. Without careful design such sites can also reduce the diversity of potential users by creating barriers to access for disabled users. By analysing two recent award-winning sites, this paper shows how rich multimedia content can be designed to enhance accessibility, and, conversely, that 'text-only' sites may reduce the accessibility of a site while unnecessarily increasing costs. We conclude that in order to 'square the triangle' of diversity, access and accessibility, the solution lies in thinking in terms of improvements in overall usability, rather than simply responding to the concept of 'accessibility' as it is narrowly defined by laws and official guidelines. However, our ability to apply this thinking is constrained by the limitations of current accessibility assessment tools such as Bobby. We describe a reduced but key set of accessibility checks, suggest a set of heuristics for undertaking them, and illustrate their application upon the sites in question."

Topics to be covered include the relationship between the identity of the on-line retail environment and the Museum's overall identity, links and crossover between the two sites, and the impact one site has on the other. We will also discuss common functions, such as e-news, search, and traffic reporting."

    "abstract": "The Internet has changed how heritage institutions can deliver content, and on-line audiences in 2006 are much more sophisticated about what they expect and demand from the Internet. The Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) is developing and deploying innovative strategies and tools to effectively determine its audiences' overall engagement with the Virtual Museum of Canada (VMC) (virtualmuseum.ca). In existence since March 2001, the VMC is a cultural gateway created by CHIN in collaboration with the Canadian museum community. Ultimately, the interaction between the VMC and its audiences must be seen as a discourse in which the audience is central to a new type of communication, where they are target and co-creator. Our approach to audience analysis must therefore respond accordingly."

    "abstract": "Social tagging applications such as flickr and del.icio.us have become extremely popular. Their socially-focussed data collection strategies seem to have potential for museums struggling to make their collections more accessible and to build communities of interest around their holdings. But little is known about the terminology that visitors to museum sites might contribute or how best to obtain both useful terms and on-going social involvement in tagging museum collections. In the steve.museum project, a number of art museums are collaboratively researching this opportunity. These research questions and an architecture for a prototype research application are presented here. Prototypes created to date are discussed and plans for future development and term-collection prototype deployment are presented. We discuss the potential use of folksonomy within museums and the requirements for post-processing of terms that have been gathered, both to test their utility and to deploy them in useful ways."

Now that the groundwork has been laid, are there signs indicating that the situation is changing? As the industry matures and develops adaptive expertise, it appears we are moving into a dramatic expansion of our collective knowledge and understanding of how technology can broaden and strengthen our museum teaching practices while delivering our content to the masses. Based on cases presented in previous Museums and the Web Proceedings, this paper will provide a historical perspective and overview of the field, and will examine select art, science and history museum education departments to see where they have been and where they are heading with the integration of technology. Moreover, this paper will examine how an on-line presence has influenced museum education in general, and some institutions specifically. Inquiry and methodology will include case study reviews, an examination of current research, interviews with museum educators, administrators and other personnel, questionnaires and, wherever possible, on-line visits."

    "abstract": "The V&A was one of the earliest adopters of Wireless networking in Europe as it offered a cost effective solution for providing network access for operational functions where the historic fabric of the building made it very difficult to get approval for traditional copper cabling. We have charted the progress of technology and standards, and have first hand experience of the problems of security and reliability inherent in the technology. We now have an IP based telephony system at the main South Kensington site, and have to manage a fully converged network that requires standards of reliability hitherto unknown in the museum. We have progressed from using Wireless networks for internal use to providing interactives and digital installations in the galleries, and hope to use Wireless as the main technology for providing digital activities in the galleries. With the opening of the Education Study Centre in 2007, we will be providing full open wireless access facilities to students and visitors, and have planned the infrastructure and security necessary to manage them in a cost effective and safe manner. We look forward to sharing experiences with other academic institutions that have similarly opened up their networks."

    "abstract": "Since the year 2002, Politecnico di Milano has been developing several educational projects aimed at schools, based on advanced technology (3D virtual worlds, shared over the Internet). The two most recent projects are about history: Learning@Europe (www.learningateurope.net) deals with the formation of European nation-states, and Stori@Lombardia (www.storialombardia.it) with medieval history in Northern Italy. Both projects underwent massive testing in spring 2005, thanks to the support of Accenture Foundation and the regional Government of Lombardy. L@E involved almost 1000 students and 60 teachers from 6 different European countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Poland, Norway, Spain); Stori@Lombardia involved 800 students and 40 teachers from Lombardy region (Italy). A huge amount of data was collected in order to verify the cultural impact of the project. The projects were very successful — beyond our expectations — both in terms of pedagogical impact and of customer satisfaction. The paper will present the most relevant data and the most salient aspects of the qualitative analysis. It will also argue a generalization of this case study, exploring how a deep impact (cultural and pedagogical) upon users can be achieved through technology, and in particular, the role of \"virtual presence\" in collaborative 3D virtual environments."

It describes the case study of Keskustelukartta (Conversational map) in the context of the museum of Taidehalli. Keskustelukartta is an interactive installation that was deployed in the Young Artists' Biennale: Small Heaven in November 2005. The installation uses ImaNote (Image Map Annotation Notebook), a Web-based multi-user tool under development in the Media Lab. Keskustelukartta makes it possible for visitors, artists and museum staff to participate actively by leaving comments and links to multimedia resources in a common interactive board. Visitors who have already visited the exhibition can access the Web site remotely and add remarks. There is a whole new field to discover, involving visitors and artists in making the content of the museum visit. Multiple voices for the multiple artefacts in the exhibition enrich the experience."

Too much data, complex business rules, ambiguous ownership, multiple platforms, poor documentation, and inadequate funding force many museums to step away from information access projects just at the moment when they are beginning to have enough information to make integration useful. A data strategy focused on reducing complexity in executive, technological, and data-centric domains can provide a stable platform for the development of Web sites, kiosks, and handheld computer guides and can help organizations realize the full value of their information."

    "abstract": "Historic documents present a rich social legacy and should be available to all. On-line retrieval of documents is a growing solution, but access creates many problems. One important problem is interface, or how exactly one interacts with a digital representation of a document. Inattention to interface issues such as navigation, image quality, ease of use can make the experience less than satisfactory. Additionally, capturing the context of the document is a particular challenge for on-line presentation. We explore various Web-based historic document retrieval sites and review them with an eye towards useful interaction design. Using existing established and accepted Human-Computer Interface (HCI) principles, we systematically identify the most common design flaws and omissions. We also identify positive interface traits and possibly map our findings to the success or popularity of the systems. At the heart of our search is a desire to find ways of presenting documents that are at once accessible and rich. We search for sites that convey texture and age and condition. We hope to find sites that allow manipulation of the document in intuitive ways. We hope to discover best practices around maintaining the document in context of its covering and time period. And we hope to find compelling ways to personally annotate the documents in unobtrusive but meaningful ways. It is hoped that the analyses of a variety of sites will yield a set of issues to avoid and key features to include, information useful to museums beginning document retrieval programs."

    "year": "2006",
    "abstract": "Virtual characters developed in rich-media play increasingly valuable and conspicuous roles in educational games and courseware, but they can be detrimental to the instructional value of these materials when used inappropriately. The guidelines presented here draw upon learning theory, cognitive psychology, studies in human-computer interaction, and narrative theory to provide a framework for placing virtual characters in the optimal \"teachable moments\". Our work with the National Constitution Center in the development of the on-line interactive exhibit, Abraham Lincoln's Crossroads serves as the case study in light of which we have developed these guidelines. We focus on the human-like value of a virtual mentor in courses modeled on \"cognitive apprenticeship\", describing the three principal roles played by the mentor. We then explore the social psychology behind the high engagement these characters offer, the instructional events an educational game must provide, and the structure of a typical story line. We describe the elements — including interactivity — that must be added to stories to make them more fully educational and identify the parts of a story in which the characters can best present facts, concepts, processes, procedures, or principles. We conclude by noting ways in which today's understanding of narrative comprehension demands careful attention to graphic illustration in stories and by presenting the reader with a straightforward process for aligning story genre, story events, and virtual character placement with the educator's learning objectives."

Profiles in Science features digital reproductions of historical items selected from the archival collections of the NLM as well as from collaborating institutions. In addition to the expected challenges posed by technological evolution, our experience with Profiles in Science over the years has taught us that change affects virtually every area of our project, including established procedures, project mission, legal considerations, and stakeholder expectations. Sustaining a digital library requires surviving all types of change. This paper will include a behind-the-scenes look at situations we have faced and will continue to encounter, as well as a 'survival guide' for coping with change. By sharing our experiences and strategies, we hope to provide those planning new digital projects a glimpse at what they may face over time. Institutions with established projects may discover challenges and strategies they have not previously encountered and may be inspired to improve these coping methods."

A cost-effective development of the overall 'system' is made possible by a suite of tools that constitute an enterprise framework for cultural tourism. They offer a semi-complete application skeleton that can be easily adapted to produce customized Web sites in this domain. The MEDINA framework implements a 'model-based', 'end-user development' approach: built for and with domain experts (cultural tourism specialists), MEDINA provides a set of user-friendly functionalities that hide the implementation complexity and can be used by users with no technical know-how to design a Web site by remodelling, to set up a (customized) design schema with the proper multimedia contents, and to dynamically generate applications on-the-fly, as the development process proceeds."

This poses a problem to the sector: existing audiences are easy to reach; new audiences are much harder to get to, and are often resistant to traditional approaches. This paper shows how new technology can be used as a way not only of opening up collections to new audiences but also of engaging audiences on a deeper level than ever before through participation. Drawing on the experience and lessons learned from a raft of interactive projects, this paper looks at how to understand and define audiences, how to design virtuous circles of content that encourage and promote participation, and how to team up with the right organisations to reach target audiences."

Working with a user-experience firm based in San Francisco, we gained a better understanding of who visits the National Gallery's Web site, why they come, and their expectations once they are on the site. Several different kinds of investigations were undertaken to achieve the project's goals: interviews with core stakeholders inside the Gallery an on-line user survey, to understand who the users are and what they expect a \"freelisting\" exercise, to provide a picture of all the activities that users wanted to perform on the site remote usability testing, to discover how well users were able to interact with the current site and find what they needed This paper reviews the first three methods and discusses a summary of results of the entire project, but concentrates on the final phase of the research, which involved \"remote usability testing.\" This research involved a Web-based method of testing, rather than a usability lab, and it allowed us to recruit participants from widespread locations to observe their screen movements \"live\" as they attempted to accomplish tasks on the site. The site evaluation yielded a wealth of data that will be used to make improvements in the design of the Gallery's Web site as well as to make the site more responsive to our users' needs and expectations."

At GMRI, 5th and 6th grade students conduct their own in-depth, simulated marine research investigations, including handling and observing both live and dead specimens. Investigations are facilitated through networked, interactive computer research stations with digital video dissecting microscopes, video notebook report cameras and aquarium schooling tank cameras. Teams of students make virtual trips into the Gulf of Maine to record scientific data using actual echogram images, and to conduct commercial fishing expeditions based upon a realistic economic simulation. Students record their observations with their digital tools and present their findings in summary 'peer review' sessions. All of the students' hypotheses, evidence and findings are saved to individual personal science notebook Web sites which they and their teachers and parents can access at school or home. On their personal sites, students can annotate, update and export all of their digital movies and images to create additional extended research reports."

    "year": "2006",
    "abstract": "In the museum world, the age-old model of 'one-way' experience creation has remained largely unchallenged. Historically, museum staff and consultants have most often been the ones to conceive of exhibition topics, interpret the content and design the experiences that the public encounters. But today, a major shift in building exhibitions is under way  a shift that will profoundly influence not only the way institutions operate but also the reach and ultimate impact they have. This paradigm shift exists on the Internet, and it is in cyberspace that a new wave of \"museum makeovers\" will come to the fore. This trend is reflected in the Exhibit Commons (http://www.exhibitcommons.org), a new project led by Liberty Science Center, that explores technology-driven societal forces, and experiments with how they may influence science center/museum visits, whether guests are physically on-site or engaging from afar. Through the Web and the experiences found at Exhibit Commons, guests will be able to shape and mould actual exhibition and programmatic elements at the Science Center, expanding the definition of an interactive museum experience. Guests will not merely encounter prescribed, predetermined experiences; they will also find numerous ways to change exhibits using creative problem solving. Looking forward, a natural offshoot of this new, participatory approach to exhibition development is that guests will also have opportunities to be involved in open community invention and creativity. This may lead to wholly new developments in the science center field. As important, for Liberty Science Center the Exhibit Commons is intended as a long-term exploration for igniting innovation and incorporating relevant world changes into the experiences we provide, as well as into our organizational culture."

The objective of this mixed methods study was to better understand the informational value of a Holocaust Museum exhibition in its on-site vs. on-line format by converging quantitative and qualitative data. Using student responses to closed-ended questions on an on-line exhibition survey, an analysis of variance was performed to determine which scenario of a museum exhibition visit promotes the greatest content learning. Using student responses to open-ended questions on the same survey, data were analyzed to discover the impact on students of each scenario of a museum exhibition visit. By means of an empathy testing instrument, data were analyzed to determine any differences among student response according to the scenario of exhibition visit. Participants in the study included six eighth grade language arts classes who viewed various combinations of the on-site and on-line versions of Life in Shadows. The study's findings could have implications for teachers and museum educators, suggesting ways to effectively integrate technology in the classroom. Obtaining visitor feedback to the on-site and on-line versions of Life in Shadows could aid museum personnel in improving efforts at exhibit design and evaluation. Could the use of a museum Web site be considered an alternative or a supplement to an on-site museum visit?"

    "abstract": "Discover Babylon is a research and development project involving UCLA's Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI), the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) and the Walters Art Museum (WAM). It focuses on how new information technologies (and game technology in particular) can enable key recommendations of modern learning science and bring new life, meaning, and excitement to museum and library collections. Synthetic learning environments allow visitors to see the objects used in context, manipulate them, and ask questions about them from characters in the game. Games offer an exploratory environment in which learners can engage in experiential, active, problem-based learning, receive immediate feedback, and create their own pathways to knowledge. Collections can be virtually reassembled to create a richer appreciation of a single artifact or a deeper understanding of a whole culture. The project emphasizes technology-enhanced learning experiences that encourage intergenerational dialogues by groups of museum audiences and that reach non-traditional museum visitors. It does this with a process that carefully integrates development and evaluation of new leaning system. The project is creating an immersive learning game that is designed to teach players about the cultural legacy of ancient Mesopotamia. The game features historically accurate virtual worlds; digital representations of museum and library objects, challenges to keep learners motivated and engaged, a question and answer tool that allows players to receive timely and relevant answers, and immediate assessments that let learners know they have mastered skills and content. The project's long term research goal is to develop a scalable, replicable tool useful for other types of collections and museums. This paper will outline the process and challenges of undertaking such a project and touch on some of the more promising directions for future research in the area of learning games for museums and library resources."

The latter consists of the set of \"signs\" (i.e. labels, icons, words, etc....) used to provide interaction to users. The paper proposes W-SIDE, a method (based upon ontologies and semiotics) for analyzing the quality of the interface language, and its impact upon users.

We need to build digital culture that lives in Google-land, as well as on a good old- fashioned Web site with walls, navigation and a loyal audience. The popularity of RSS and Web 2.0 means we have the opportunity now to develop new ways to publish on-line: to use semantic tagging, to make clusters of related cultural content 'hang together' in search engine results. Is this realistic? The paper explores routes to making this possible and envisions a digital museum comprised of millions of particles of content, from multiple museum sources, turned 'inside out' in search engine land."

The users chosen for the study include persons who are blind or have low vision, persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, persons with learning disabilities or other cognitive impairments, and persons with limited mobility. The interactives included in this study each use buttons as the primary user interface, and together, represent the variety of learning experiences that computers can provide in museum exhibitions. Study findings yield insights on how individuals with disabilities interact with computer interactives and the types of design features that are needed to provide access for an audience that includes visitors of a broad range of abilities and disabilities. In addition, findings demonstrate that certain design features support learning for a broad range of users and that features implemented to provide access for one audience can lead to improved experiences for another."

Each program featured the original historical artifacts, computer simulations that demonstrated how these artifacts move, and 3D tactile printouts that allowed visitors to explore the artifacts' shape and movement through their sense of touch. Research explored how user interaction with the digital and physical models compared to interactions with the original artifacts, what effect the integration of digital and physical models had on learning, and what the learning experience looked like for learners using the mechanisms during two different programs. Methods employed included a tracking and timing study that measured visitor attraction and engagement with the three different types of mechanisms, and visitor interviews that examined visitor perceptions of experience. Results showed that visitor preference for and engagement with the mechanisms varied greatly between the two programs. This suggests that whether visitors prefer to interact with the original artifact or the digitized reproduction may vary depending upon the context of use."

    "abstract": "Over the last 10 years UK museum Web sites have come a long way. The range of content and services now offered is astonishing and inspiring. Public investment has been impressive, and on-line visits to these sites continue to exceed general trends. Ambitious digitisation projects have resulted in a wealth of assets that are regularly put to innovative use, while partnerships across organisations are stimulating an enhanced, networked culture. Of course museum Web sites continue to supply visitors with opening times, tickets and transport options, but research suggests that they are increasingly augmenting, extending and on occasion even replacing physical visits. If such a dramatic transformation has been achieved in only 10 years, then what can we expect to happen in the next 10? Can we learn from the successes of the past decade? What challenges remain to be overcome? Which dotcom era buzz-words continue to hold promise? Do any seriously new technologies still await us? Can we afford to be complacent, or is there a danger that UK museum Web sites will fail to realise their potential? Answers to these and other questions will be presented in this paper for reflection and discussion, and in the firm belief that the best is still to come."

    "abstract": "The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's monthly series SFMOMA Artcasts, coproduced with Bay Area audio experts Antenna Audio, Inc., explores current issues and ideas in modern and contemporary art. While we are still honing the program, we have learned quite a bit over the last six months about what makes a successful podcast. We have preliminary answers to some questions. What is the best use of this new medium? Is a podcast just a traditional audio tour in a new guise? If not, how is it different? How does its distribution model facilitate communication? How can it be used to initiate dialogue with younger audiences? What are the institution-wide challenges of launching a new -- and, for some, completely unfamiliar -- means of delivering content? Using SFMOMA's experience as a case study, this paper offers insights into the challenges of producing content in-house versus outsourcing the task to professionals. It also examines the Museum's use of podcasts as a way of inviting artists, musicians, writers, and the general public to submit their own content, addressing the hurdles associated with bringing what was initially considered a \"guerrilla\" medium into a curatorially sanctioned space."

    "year": "2006",
    "abstract": "In Museums with diverse collection types, the objective of creating an accessible repository which spans the entire collection is fraught with difficulty, in terms of systems and organizational culture. For example, at the V&A, separate systems (managed by separate departments) store information about bibliographic objects, non-bibliographic objects, and archives. Yet both the public and Museum staff think of and work with the collection as a single entirety. Conservation may need to conserve both bibliographic objects and non-bibliographic objects; the Museum needs to consider loans and exhibitions that will span books, objects and the archive; and the public seeks information about the entire collection on-line. The V&A's Core Systems Integration Project (CSIP) seeks to address this need by making an aggregation of this information available. The project has taken the view that in aggregating data, it must not change where data is mastered (i.e., all editing remains in the \"core systems\"). Therefore the technical architecture of this \"Common Data Model\" loosely based on SPECTRUM, which identifies the equivalencies (and non-equivalencies) of the aggregated information, will be made available through a \"Web Services\" layer, rather than by means of a data warehouse. Because the language of \"Web Services\" is XML, (i.e. it receives its query, and formulates and sends its response in XML), it is ideally suited to light-weight browser-based applications that can use the information in accordance with the functionality they are designed to address. The IT industry calls this kind of technical architecture \"a services oriented architecture\" (SOA). But for the Web, and indeed for Museums on the Web, the potential of Web Services is much wider than providing an internal standard that helps to structure an application layer. Today Web sites are largely built around the notion of providing html that (even when sourcing a database that is accessed through search and retrieve) is static in the way it is presented and what can be done with it. Information from separate sites cannot be combined. Web services addresses this by offering a means of providing access to the base data, allowing the world to do what it likes with that data."

    "abstract": "Modern technology provides new opportunities for museums to enhance museum visit experience. Multimedia is one aspect of modern technology that can enhance museum visit experience. However, the use of multimedia poses new challenges for presentation preparation — how to enrich the visit while not replacing the real objects in the museum that must remain in the focus of the visit, how to allow rich information space suitable for a great variety of visitors, how to encourage interaction among visitors and more. These challenges need to be addressed during planning and preparation of information presentations for mobile, personalized, multimedia museum visitors' guides. In addition to the conceptual aspects, there are technical aspects such as text and images selection and integration, applying various cinematographic techniques and using the right language for the spoken text. This work presents lessons learned at the PEACH and PIL projects in preparation of multimedia presentations for mobile, personalized museum visitors' guide. Presentations designers needed to reason about the exhibitions, their objects and information that may be interesting for the visitors. They had to do that while planning the presentations preparation and then, in light of the generic goals, elicit relevant text and images and combine those using cinematographic techniques into multimedia presentations. All the above resulted in a \"presentation generation road map\" — a nine-step multimedia presentations preparation framework that is described and presented in this paper."

Since the first Museums and the Web conference in Los Angeles in 1997, numerous papers, presentations and discussions have hinted at the opportunities, as well as significant challenges, that the creation of this new ubiquitous hybrid, will undoubtedly entail."

The museum used it to draw attention to its new Web site in a playful way. The campaign was an experiment, because even though the business community has long been exploiting the potential of viral buzz marketing to the full, the use of these techniques is still quite uncommon in the museum world. Many cultural institutions still tend to think in terms of traditional marketing methods which they are eager to keep, in line with their house style and cultural image. The Mauritshuis took its chances and reports on its findings in this case study. The article starts with the underlying theory. What is buzz and viral marketing? What value does this form of marketing add for museums? Subsequently, the Mauritshuis campaign is described in more detail. What was the idea behind the campaign? What was the museum aiming at with this campaign? What went well and what could have been better? And most of all: would we recommend it to you?"

The changing face of the virtual society, the developments in information and communication technologies and their use suggest that personalization, convenience, and meaningful interactivity through online services would help museums further impassion and engage the public in the coming years. Although the global influence of technologies is transforming our economy and society, technology alone does not create knowledge. Technology can only serve to empower people to develop new knowledge. Our approach must therefore place people at the centre of the process. This keynote presentation discusses several environmental trends in the virtual realm and how they might be leveraged to enhance the overall heritage experience."

    "abstract": "The Netherlands is a relatively small country. Museums and cultural institutions are located within a small distance of each other. Not just Amsterdam but the whole country has a high density of art & culture. This is unique worldwide. But in spite of the highly concentrated offerings of museums, monuments and theatres in the Netherlands, the Dutch seldom are aware that there is a cultural location or event close to their home or office. They just pass it everyday without noticing. ZaPPWeRK initiated Culture around the Corner to make people more aware of art/culture in their surroundings. Via this location-based service, information about the nearest place of interest is sent to users and received by mobile phone, PDA or Laptop. Users do not need to enter their locations: this is detected automatically. This non-profit project resulted in a national cultural platform in which the Netherlands Department for Conservation, the Netherlands Museums Association and the National Service for Archaeological Heritage take part. Existing techniques are combined in a creative way. Up till now location based services were not very common in the Netherlands. The goal of the project is to achieve and maintain a public database in which all Dutch cultural locations are stored. This information is available without charge, for cultural and educational purposes. Technology partners can use this platform in order to research and develop new location-based services. All devices and all techniques will be integrated, connected and tested. The functionalities will be made available for cultural partners."

    "abstract": "With the number of UK households and small businesses adopting broadband now passing the 3 million mark, museums need to consider the approaches they can use to present curator's expertise to new audiences in engaging ways for broadband. Whilst these impressive statistics represent a strong picture in the technological rollout of broadband, they do not reveal the social innovation occurring through the development of truly broadband sites. Too many Web sites claiming to be 'broadband' offer little more than video on the Web, and many fail to construct sites that socially engage users in on-line activities. The paper will argue that in order to create appealing broadband Web sites, producers need to bring together the skills and quality of television production with the active participation of the Web. In this way the creation of broadband Web sites presents new opportunities for museums to deliver public service values."

    "abstract": "We can consider Web browsing as a similar experience to visiting a museum, when we take decisions about where to stop and where to skip over the exhibited objects. This is the same in museums; there are some tools available to help people select what they want to see such as maps, brochures, etc. Just as in a real museum, where maps and brochures help people organize their visit, search engines support the user in their navigation on the Web by assisting them in finding the most relevant material, while ignoring the rest. The Web is a unique \"museum\" where there are all sorts of data, including multimedia objects, so it is particularly crucial to respect the potentially different attitudes of users that may have various interests and different perspectives. (This is once again the same in museums.) The role of search engines is particularly problematic because they have to guarantee the efficiency of the service without betraying the multiplicity of users'purposes. The aim of this paper is to show the result of testing the difficulty of access to useful museum-related resources that are not very well known, but contain relevant information when search engines and other query techniques are used. We will show that many museum Websites and databases belong to the hidden part of the Web that is not accessible unless the precise URL is known. We will discuss some practical issues on finding museum information and how museums could improve their search rankings and their own searching facilities, especially with respect to the widely used Google search engine. Further, we will introduce some promising solutions for finding museums' Websites and searching within them, such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) search tools, intelligent agents that are specialized for information retrieval using \"clustering\" strategies based on user preferences, as well as systems of collaborative filtering and collaborative categorization from user experiences and judgments, allowing a personalized search. All these alternative methods have only a little in common, but share the characteristics of respecting the decentralized and dynamic topology of the Web, while search engines are based on traditional techniques of information retrieval; namely, strategies to access pre-structured data using the appropriate pre-established queries. The Web cannot be compared to a repository of structured data; it requires the development of innovative approaches and methods that take into account its chaotic nature. For all these reasons we do not consider the metadata solution here in detail, despite its role in searching specific museum collections on-line; we believe that there are interesting alternative methods to investigate for the future."

    "abstract": "In museums, natural sciences collections reflect past and present faunal and floral biodiversity and the geology of the earth. These collections are characterized by having many duplicate specimens of each species, with variation in collection locality and time. This is in contrast to cultural collections where few duplicates may be collected and the unique value of each object is emphasized. Museum collection management systems that document natural sciences collections are usually highly structured and have few fields that contain interpreted data (information). Each individual specimen record carries little special meaning. Again, this is in contrast to cultural collections where individual objects may be endowed with a great deal of meaning; may be extensively documented; and may even be accorded iconic status in an institution's collection. The challenge in presenting natural sciences collections on the Web is to construct meaning from the individual, duplicate specimens. Whilst the precise data for a single specimen may not be interesting to an on-line user, a map showing information about a species may be. Users may be interested in how common the species is, what its geographical distribution is, and whether that distribution has changed over time. In Australia, and across the world, there are a number of searchable Web sites of natural sciences collections. Common to all is the ability to derive new meanings from individual specimens. This is often achieved by combining specimen data points in a graphic way to provide information about the species. One such project, the Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums (OZCAM), Australia's Fauna Web site, is a collaboration among all the major and several minor natural sciences collecting institutions in Australia to present museum collections on-line. Further collaborations are made with the Collections Australia Network, who provide technical support and who host the site, and with software providers KE Software, who have developed the portal and display software. The OZCAM, Australia's Fauna project, will be described and used as an illustration of how multi-institutional collaborations can provide greater access and meaning to natural sciences collections on the Web."

Successful Web site design depends inter alia on understanding and accommodating users' needs, and the more heterogeneous they are, the more difficult this is to achieve. In this paper we examine two models for handling diversity in on-line audiences, one developed specifically for museum Web sites, the other developed for curriculum design and media selection. Both models consider the need to go beyond mere publishing of information. We argue a case for synthesizing the two models and use a hybrid version to deconstruct the design of two different heritage Web sites."

    "abstract": "American History is often undervalued, disliked and ignored by both students and teachers in today's schools. This paper looks at the incarnation of an on-line object-based educational (K-12) Web site which helps enliven teaching and learning history. With content steeped in the topic of the American Revolutionary War era, the site intends to provide the experience of direct engagement with rich and diverse historical resources to educators and learners. This occurs in multiple ways throughout the site; however, it is the site's main feature -- the on-line exhibition tool -- that embraces object-based learning methodologies to promote the development of skill sets in information literacy, evaluation and higher-ordered critical thinking for educators and learners alike. As users learn how to curate their own exhibitions, they also begin to understand and practise the historical processes of weighing evidence and developing methods of inquiry, thereby learning to think like historians. Active participation in learning through the incorporation of primary material in classroom instruction greatly improves student interest, ability to retain knowledge, and overall satisfaction with the learning and teaching process. The integration of primary sources and new media technologies is reshaping the way education is practised. And access to primary sources, once the sole domain of curators and scholars, in an on-line format levels the playing field and opens the possibilities for greater meaning to the legacy that is history,s at any age."

    "abstract": "The Web is such a powerful and comprehensive medium that we usually consider it as a world apart. But the Web fully develops its potential when combined with other media. For example, when integrated with broadcast media such as radio and TV, it can provide the interactivity and in-depth content that broadcast media cannot offer. On the other hand, broadcast media can provide the massive audience Web sites usually lack. Moreover, digital formats are making media boundaries less and less significant, and increasingly media products (such as TV formats) are thought of as structurally multi-media. The concept of medium is now crossing the borders of traditional media like radio or newspapers. Pervasive and mediated environments such as conventions, theme parks, and museums are nowadays considered media. The paper will present case histories of successful and interesting integration of the Web and other media, with a specific focus on cultural usages. For example, a very successful TV program by Channel 4, TimeTeam Big Dig, used the Web to involve its watchers in a vast collective archaeological experiment in the UK, with unexpected results. Also, integration between Web and radio was the key for the success of Lifegate, a small local Italian radio station that combined in a very effective way the different characteristics of the two media. Now one of the most important radio stations in the area, Lifegate simply would not exist without the Web. Another successful case of integration was MuVi, a cultural program from another Italian radio station. MuVi asked people to send old photos to the Web, rapidly creating a vast and valuable on-line visual database of recent Milan history; in this case the radio was key to reach audiences (older people) not reachable via the Web, and to create a sense of community necessary for the collecting operation. Finally, by examining the main characteristics of the Web as they emerge in comparison to other media, we will have a look at how far the Web has been integrated with the Museum as a medium, trying to get from this analysis some suggestions for future steps in this direction."

The three Science Bulletins -- Astro, Earth, and Bio -- present ongoing research and recent discoveries in astrophysics, Earth sciences, and biodiversity. Each bulletin has three types of stories: features, data visualizations, and news snapshots. The stories are updated on a weekly basis on high-definition video displays and interactive kiosks in the halls, and on the Science Bulletins' Web site. The Science Bulletins' Web site is assembled using a new publishing system developed in-house using open source software. The new publishing system replaces a third-party custom solution, and incorporates the lessons learned from that first venture. In particular, a clean separation of content and presentation provides flexibility for the interface and feature set to evolve. The flexibility has allowed the team to add new features, such as learning activities for each story, published on the same schedule as the content."

The general results of the four sub-projects that are completed are reported here. The first is a meta-analysis of reports the Musée dart contemporain de Montréal had commissioned about its users from the founding of the museum in 1964 to the present day. The second project offers a profile of the clientele of the museum's Médiathèque, both on site and via the Web. The third project reported here is a typology of the data housed in various information systems at the museum. The fourth analyses the orientations, choices and perceptions of digital information by museum professionals who develop concepts for exhibitions and who carry out other mediation of digital information. The sub-projects carried out in the context of DigiCulture were a rich source of information that helped us learn a great deal about user behaviours in a museum environment."

It is a collaborative effort between Nunavut Sivuniksavut, a special college program based in Ottawa, and serving Inuit Youth from Nunavut; the Government of Nunavut's Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth; and Library and Archives Canada. The goal of this project is the identification of Inuit portrayed in the photographic collections of Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa. It is an ongoing initiative which enables Nunavut Youth to connect with Elders and to better understand their past. It also helps to bridge the cultural differences and geographical distances between the territory of Nunavut and the more southern parts of Canada."

    "abstract": "The building excitement of the information age: new solutions; faster, better, cheaper; possibilities of new audiences; interactive, hands-on, minds-on learning; visions of paradigm shifts: the optimist view. Each new solution as if it were the messiah, but simply repackaged old ideas; a sense of hectic-ness; funded projects but difficulty in sustaining successes; lots of beauty but little learning; frustration: the pessimist view. Whether you are an optimist or pessimist or somewhere along the continuum, there is no debating that the quality and professionalism of museum Web sites has increased dramatically since the foundations of Museums and the Web. We are far from the days where Web site creation was a secondary add-on to a museum staff member's busy schedule; sites are now designed by creative professionals who specialize in marrying content and design to education and entertainment. What will happen from here? What will be the look and feel of Web sites of the future? How do we look down the road to see what's coming? With the distinct lack of summative evaluation there is no way to differentiate sites except by what is judged worthy by the field itself. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi writes that it is not just the individual excelling in a chosen domain of expertise but also the response of the field that marks creativity and innovation. Using this framework, this paper will address the nature of successful museum Web sites by revisiting the Best of the Best. The authors compile award-winning museum Web sites of past years and conduct in-depth interviews with the designers and developers behind those sites. Their thoughts and reflections will be integrated with past and current trends in the cyclical development of educational technology to provide a road map of what we might see next."

    "abstract": "In October, 2000, the Space Science Institute of Boulder, Colorado, launched MarsQuest: a 5000 square foot traveling exhibition on Mars and Mars science. Two years later NSF and NASA gave their support to an associated Web project called MarsQuest Online, a partnership between TERC, the Space Science Institute, and JPL. The goal of the MarsQuest Online project was to create a Web site that extended both the reach and scope of the traveling exhibition. The program was premised on the idea that the effort expended on the museum exhibition - the exhibition framework, interactive concepts, educational goals, etc. - could be leveraged into a highly interactive on-line experience. MarsQuest Online has now been live for over a year, and has had well over a half million visits. Site visitors have flown over Mars in 3D, driven rovers, chosen potential landing sites, and followed NASA's MER rovers as they explore the surface. However, quoting numbers of visitors begs the real question for any education project: what have visitors learned? More broadly, is the project a success as an informal learning experience, as the physical exhibit was? If so, how does one define and demonstrate on-line learning? Answering these questions has always been a central part of the project. In addition to a more traditional formative evaluation, which examined the usability of the pieces, MarsQuest Online includes a summative evaluation that contains two primary components. First, the interactives on the site were programmed to record user activities into a database that can be mined to obtained detailed information about visitors' interactions. Second, Randi Korn & Associates, were hired to conduct a series of standardized interviews. These interviews, conducted with science center visitors, included three groups: those who visited the MarsQuest exhibit but not the Web site; those who visited the Web site but not the exhibit, and those who visited both. In that way we hoped to determine how the exhibit and the Web site, together and separately, affect visitors' attitudes and knowledge about Mars and Mars exploration. This paper will discuss the MarsQuest Online project, the motivations behind this evaluation program, its challenges, and results."

    "abstract": "Classical Internet Web sites are passive: visitors can only read the information presented. There are several possibilities to integrate interaction in Web sites with the goal of making visitors feel more comfortable and letting them spend a longer time on the Web site. Typical possibilities like trivia quizzes, interactive simulation applets and more lack any creative potential. Some forms of modern communication technology offer a wider range of interaction, but remain relatively unknown and thus unused. Such interaction is often more social. One example is Wiki Webs, which are tools for collaborative work: the user is part of a community and can add content to a Web site or edit existing content. For museums, both virtual and real, Wiki Web technology can be interesting because visitors are able to change the information content of the exhibition in several ways, and thus leave their own individual traces in the exhibition. The Wikiseum of Bad Movies, which is introduced in this paper, is a virtual exhibition which uses the interactive potential of Wiki Webs. It supports both a static exhibition, where the visitor is really just visitor, and an interactive exhibition, where the visitor can be active and interactively create the exhibition."

    "abstract": "Museums are playing active roles in modern societies beyond preserving a society's cultural heritage. They have become an important learning environment, and some of them even are tourist attractions. But traditional storytelling aids for museums consisting of texts and labels may not be personalized to fit each individual personal taste and are static sources of information. This paper explores the notion of Hybrid Museum (HM) in which wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) are used to tailor content to the visitor to enrich both the learning and entertainment experience. The customization and personalization of the displayed contents is achieved by implementing a modified Partial Prediction Matching algorithm and a distributed Ant Colony System algorithm to find optimal itineraries within the museum, even with constrained time."

    "abstract": "Many cultural institutions face the challenges of making their collections accessible and interpreting them on-line. But what if the 'collection' isn't something on a wall, in a case, or in storage, but is a house, a ship, a 5,000-acre plantation, or all the tombs in the Valley of the Kings? This is an in-depth look at how museums can create rich, immersive interactive sites that connect on-line audiences with places and spaces,- and the ideas, people, objects and histories that have inhabited them. This genre of museum site provides accessibility to physically restrictive locations including remote locales, endangered sites, restricted or dangerous areas, inaccessible rooms, and places that no longer exist. Since most house museums were built before ADA guidelines, these Web sites create new opportunities for disabled visitors to explore places they have never been. Experiences can go beyond the physical limitations of real geographies and beyond the chronological constraints of the present, revealing how a place evolved over time. Building on the lessons learned from the Theban Mapping Project, Yin Yu Tang, and the new interactive Monticello Explorer site, Second Story and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation examine the genesis, process and result of their exciting new database-driven 3D experience that brings Jefferson, his house and plantation to life on-line."

Exhibits focusing on wildlife and habitat conservation, nutrition and health, advocacy, and family learning/literacy all hinge on making a change in the visitors' behavior after they leave the museum. Yet there is surprisingly little research about how often museum exhibits, much less museum Web sites, actually lead to changes in visitor behavior. To promote further discussion and research in the field, we review some of the challenges and promising examples in the museum field. We also review some of the considerations that went into the development of Conservation Central, selected Best Museum Web site at Museums and the Web 2004, which we developed for Smithsonian's National Zoo. We conclude by proposing a set of Web site guidelines that include goals for encouraging behavioral change among visitors."

    "abstract": "Museums and galleries are becoming increasing rich in digital information. This is often created for internal activities such as cataloguing, curation, conservation and restoration, but also has many additional uses including gallery terminals, Web access, educational, scientific, and commercial licensing. New forms of multimedia content such as 3D models and virtual spaces have huge potential for enhancing the way people interact with museum collections; for example, in structured eLearning environments. Despite drivers for increased integration of information sources within the museum or gallery, and for improved Web accessibility for external users, this content is often hard to access and is held in multiple internal systems with non-standard schemas and descriptions. Providing information to external users or applications in a structured and machine-readable form is particularly difficult due to a lack of tools and standards. This makes it difficult to expose this rich source of information so it can be used over the Web in external applications. Over the past three years, the European Commission IST supported SCULPTEUR project has been addressing these problems by developing new ways to create, search, navigate, access, share, repurpose and use multimedia content over the Web for professional users. This paper describes the tools and techniques developed in the project."

    "abstract": "Ugandans aspire for positive cultural values for the promotion of socio-economic development and equal opportunities for all -- a heritage that is free of negative cultural values, practices and traditions. However, the major constraint of developing countries has been the absence of community-based information systems to enable local people to contribute to decision-making, planning and management. While technological advancement constitutes a vital component of economic development, there is a conspicuous and persistent lack of indigenous knowledge (IK) technological advancement and a greater dependency on exogenous technologies. A qualitative research design team collected data from various IK communities and institutions that were selected purposively. Interviews, observations, and document analysis were the main forms of data collection. IK experts, knowledgeable and skilled personnel, and community leaders, among others, were selected. Data was analyzed and presented according to the main objectives and themes of the study. It was observed that there is hardly any system of recording, documenting, preserving and safeguarding documentary heritage, or of democratizing access and raising awareness of its significance to the achievement of community objectives. This paper attempts to establish the documented IK, the content, form and attributes of records kept about IK; assesses the digitization requirements; and propose strategies for its digitization in Uganda. This strategy would provide direction to various stakeholders towards the digitization process. A co-ordinating unit in the country, with appropriate management structures in place to set guidelines and carry out marketing and awareness strategy, is a priority for the appropriate digitization of IK in Uganda."

    "abstract": "The development of multidimensional storytelling embedded in physical exhibitions is investigated by the example of the new permanent exhibition medien.welten, at the Technisches Museum Wien (Vienna), which deals with history of media. Starting from traditional exhibitions with physical objects and artefacts displayed with printed text and pictures, the extension and integration of a virtual exhibition layer with digital objects and multimedia will be investigated systematically. Within the virtual layer, a two-dimensional ordering structure related to topic and time allows following stories in vertical and horizontal lines. The two dimensions make it possible to organize the stories not only according to one specific topic in chronological order, but also according to a specific time period with a topic order. Each element in this two-dimensional matrix also has inner dimensions, i.e. spaces with digital objects, for deeper levels of detailed stories and further digital exhibition spaces. The system allows access via the Web with individual user profiles. The embedding of a scientific publication platform, which is directly connected to the matrix structure, allows an interactive forum for topic-related contributions. The multi-user system also allows external experts to produce and edit content in the publication area. The whole system has recursive cycles where the content generated by the contributions in the publication platform can be used by curators to extend any of the physical or virtual parts of the exhibition system."

Though generally pleased with their patrons' responses to automated audio tours, museum administrators find that hosting them can be expensive, time consuming, and frustrating. Ongoing advances in mobile wireless technology provide an alternative to the current cumbersome method of renting sound players to museum visitors. Many patrons bring their own 'digital sound player' with them in the guise of their personal cell phone. As cell phones proliferate and the price of calling plans falls, cell phones may present a viable alternative to current audio tour systems. History Calls was a recent experiment using VXML technology to deliver an automated audio museum tour directly to patrons' cell phones."

    "abstract": "3D graphics are evidently appealing for cultural heritage communication: the possibility of (re)creating environments, buildings, objects, etc. raised great expectations, both with professionals and end-users. Actual applications, however, have turned out not be so successful as they had promised to be. Therefore we must rethink goals (what can 3D be used for?), requirements (which features should we try to achieve?) and design (how do we do it?). This paper deals with a specific niche, i.e. shared 3D worlds accessible by several users (represented by avatars) over the Internet; some of our considerations, however, can probably be extended to other types of environment. Our main point is that shared 3D worlds are effective not just because they offer a realistic reconstruction of something, but because they have the property of creating (if well designed) virtual presence, i.e. the feeling of \"being there\" with someone else, engaged in some kind of activity. We argue that, if virtual presence is what we look for, the main concern should switch from the quality of the graphics to the quality of the overall design of the application. The paper discusses the above issues on the basis of the experience gained in 3D educational projects developed by the HOC laboratory of Politecnico di Milano: SEE -- Shrine Educational Experience (in cooperation with The Israel Museum, Jerusalem), Learning@Europe (in cooperation with the International Accenture Foundation) and Stori@Lombardia (in cooperation with the Regional Government of Lombardy). These projects have so far involved more than 1400 students and teachers from all over Europe. All these projects are an evolution of Virtual Leonardo, winner of the prize as \"best on-line exhibition\" at Museums and the Web 1999."

Mobile technology enables the creation of challenging CH applications that support new on-site experiences for the public and simultaneously expose users to both physical CH resources (e.g., paintings in a museum or ruins in an archaeological park) and digital virtual resources. When \"porting\" an existing Web site for culture heritage to mobile devices, a number of design issues arise, as we discuss in this paper. We give an overview of both the potential and the limits of mobile technology, and note the implications for application design. We introduce the concept of multi-channel Web applications and explore, from a design perspective, the concept of interoperability. We discuss the issue of location awareness and its design tradeoffs. Finally, we consider the requirements of disabled users, addressing the issues of design for accessibility in mobile applications."

    "abstract": "In the current trajectory of on-line museum learning, an environment has emerged where locality and the specificity of place are now key levers for content creation and user experience. This paper explores the ways in which the on-line museum, mirroring practices in the business world and the education sector, is becoming sensitive to where its users are located. It considers how museums (on-line and off-line) have attempted to understand and make provision for individual visitor circumstance. By looking specifically at examples of localized Web-based museum resources, it highlights how museums are increasingly acknowledging the localized settings of on-line users. The paper suggests a more layered typology of localization, informed by sociological readings of spatial production, in order to differentiate between location (the physical, geographical position of the learner), place (the type of space the learner perceives himself/herself to be in), and situation (the learner's circumstance, activity or intent). It also suggests how this more discerning vocabulary (with the different implications and consequences that follow from each term) might help providers better articulate the concept of localization in order to support more focused provision and clearer objectives. Finally, by calling attention to some of the challenges that remain in developing localized resources for on-line learners, the paper ends by foregrounding some of the questions that further debate, research and the sharing of best practice may help to answer."

Version 1.0 of the RSS feed (www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/home.rss ) is working, and in January 2005, technical partners SSL developed the feed into a multi-region, multi-city, tunable content feed, capable of offering tailored output to meet specific editorial needs of the 24 HM Web site, as well as of partners in the museum sector and beyond in the UK. The paper examines the technical challenges such expansion involves. Questions about RSS version choice, scoping, determining the logistics problems and operational decisions are explored. Since this paper proposal was submitted in September 2004, there's been a gratifying leap in the popularity of RSS as a mass publishing mechanism. The writer feels the growing momentum behind the technology grandly justifies the 24 Hour Museum's initial investment in the technology in 2003 and our continued commitment to the format. A final section of the paper deals with this gathering enthusiasm within the Web world and looks at brief case studies of other museums starting to use RSS."

The new tool is based on Pachyderm, the authoring and publishing tool used by SFMOMA to author its successful series, Making Sense of Modern Art (http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma). Developed by SFMOMA to make the publication of modular and updateable rich media an easy task, the original Pachyderm toolset allowed non-programmers to create a variety of engaging resources that draw from, and build on, the collections of SFMOMA. The paper provides an overview the history, new open source specification, and the collaborative processes that have made Pachyderm 2.0 possible.

For example, the effective teacher in a face-to-face learning environment responds to various cues about the learner's knowledge, interest, and ability. We do not have that ability on-line. Instead we must attempt to formalize within the programming of the activity much of the tacit feedback to which the teacher can react. This task becomes even more difficult when we take into consideration the diverse ways that people perceive and process information. This paper reports on current research into the impact of learning style on preference for on-line informal learning experiences. Building on our pilot study of user preferences for Web-based activity types (Schaller et al., 2002), we are currently developing ways to measure children's learning styles and testing hypotheses about learning style, activity preferences, engagement, and satisfaction. An understanding of individual differences in learning styles will provide valuable insights into the specific requirements of computer-based learning media and guide developers to design more engaging and effective experiences for a wide variety of learners."

    "abstract": "A Native American basketmaker was hired to teach a college class in Indian crafts. Each day she began and ended her class by having her students sing songs she had taught them, until some of the students began to complain that they would never learn basket making at that rate. So the teacher said, \"Now we'll collect the materials for making baskets\" -- but it turned out that in order to do that she had to teach them still more songs, and the students became frustrated again. Finally, after they had collected all the materials and returned to the studio the teacher announced that she would now have to teach them still more songs in order to make the baskets. At this the students rebelled and demanded to know how to make baskets instead. To which the teacher replied, \"Don't you know that the basket only represents the song, and that the songs are really the tradition that you need to make baskets? For a basket is only a visual representation of a song.\" Web technologies have the potential to expand the depth and scope of the knowledge base by including other, often underrepresented, sources of knowledge. This paper explores a project underway at the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) that uses Web technologies to reach out to Native American communities and enables them to be active participants in the development of the knowledge base and in the sensitive care of Native American collections. The strategy goes beyond the simple 'feedback' forms on Web pages and relates directly to NMAI's mission to advance, in consultation, collaboration and cooperation with Natives, knowledge and understanding of Native cultures. The NMAI is testing a suite of Web infrastructure tools that offers Native communities opportunities to represent themselves in the knowledge base and locally manage knowledge about NMAI objects, media, and documents and related objects often stewarded by others. Focusing on technical aspects, this paper will discuss the importance of a metadata server that provides a data front end to a virtual content aggregator to bring together previously unconnected collections databases. The metadata server, which can normalize an unlimited number of metadata namespaces, is front-ended by knowledge organization applications such as XML word processors and e-learning visual studios. It allows users to create and manipulate personalized metadata driven points of view (POV) on the aggregated collections. NMAI is testing the application of these tools in its collections research, public programs, and community services activities. NMAI hopes that, by extending a level playing field using Web technologies, the knowledge base at the NMAI will serve as a public and educational resource that enables appreciation for the multiplicity of POVs of all subject matter experts."

    "abstract": "Funded by both NEH and IMLS, The Raid on Deerfield: The Many Stories of 1704 Web site is a multi-cultural collaborative effort that commemorates and reinterprets the 1704 raid on Deerfield from the perspectives of the five different groups who were present at the event: Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), Wôbanakiak (Abenaki), Wendats (Huron), the French, and the English. A tabbed approach to the multiple perspectives allows learners to move quickly and easily among the different perspectives, facilitating comparison and enabling the telling of the story from conflicting points of view without the loss of coherence in the narrative. A layered approach to the content structure permits storytelling in small, understandable, compelling segments, supported by fuller context - thereby capturing the visitor's attention and providing a rich context to satisfy the casual observer, as well as the motivated visitor. Multiple paths through the content, both within the narrative context and from an indexed list or menu, accommodate different kinds of inquiry. Special features allow for different learning styles and promote active engagement with potentially unfamiliar and challenging primary sources."

    "abstract": "In this Information Age, the Field of Dreams paradigm makes less sense than ever: \"If we build it, they will come\" presumes a didactic, one-to-many model of distribution that relies on the will for self-improvement. But now, when the answer to any question is a Google search away, and peer-review and social networking have superseded advertising as the most effective means of on-line promotion, how can museums attract and maintain large on-line audiences? This paper explores the opportunity of mass distribution and mass participation as a future means of delivering meaningful content to the on-line and non-traditional user. The Victoria and Albert Museum has partnered with Channel 4 Television, the UK's third largest broadcaster, to promote Every Object Tells a Story, a mass-participative digital storytelling project launching in March 2005. Building on the current museological emphasis in the value of objects inherent not only in themselves, but in the stories that are told about and around them, Every Object Tells a Story gives users a chance not only to comment on iconic and important objects held in national collections but also to explore significance through submitting their own stories and objects, which can in tern be commented on by their peers. This paper asks: Is mass democratisation of museum content the way to open our collections? What are the opportunities and dangers of allowing non-specialists to publish their ideas and theories in a many-to-many environment? How can partnering with the right media partner contribute to the development of mass distribution projects?"

    "author": "Gustav Taxén, Emmanuel Frécon",

    "year": "2005",
    "abstract": "During the last couple of decades, a growing body of research has provided insights into the complex processes of learning that take place in museums. Interestingly, museum-related learning is not limited to the actual visit: what takes place before and afterwards has a profound effect on the learning outcome. The study presented in this paper focuses on the post-visit aspects of the learning process. Previous research shows that visitors make connections between their experiences in the museum and experiences that happen after the visit. Sometimes these connections can occur weeks or months (or even years) after the visit, depending on when the visitor happens upon a situation that allows the connection to be made. Documenting these events is obviously quite difficult. Even though it is possible to re-establish contact with visitors after a few weeks or months (e.g., through telephone or e-mail), the information obtained is not in situ. The goal of the present study is to attempt to acquire and analyze more data from these in situ situations, and to re-present the data in an exhibition. To this end, we have designed a system that allows visitors to send images and text messages to a central server through e-mail, SMS or MMS. The data from the server can then be visualized as a weblog (blog) or in some other suitable form. We collaborated with the Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. A large part of the Museum's Science Centre is devoted to five mechanical principles: the screw, the plane slope, the lever, the wheel and the wedge. We have designed an exhibit that utilizes our system to present messages (images and text) from visitors on the subject of the five principles in the science centre itself. It is also possible to access the messages through a public Web page. From the Museum's perspective, our exhibit not only provides new opportunities for documenting post-visit learning processes, but also has the potential to provide new forms of evaluation data that might be difficult to obtain through other means. Furthermore, it allows Museum visitors to extend the original scope of the mechanical principles exhibition by allowing them to provide their own content (and reflections upon the existing content), a re-occurring theme in many recent technology-based exhibits. The paper provides a description of our system, the exhibit we have built, how the exhibit is managed, and how it has worked in practice."

    "year": "2005",
    "abstract": "As museums expand their on-line profile, they continue to ask what a virtual space can mean to an audience, the ways an audience can experience it, and how the virtual space relates to the museum's physical space. How does on-line content relate to in-house content, and should one reflect or complement the other? What do museum visitors look for on a museum's Web site, for example, either before visiting a museum in person or following an in-person visit? This paper will discuss the implications of a study undertaken in 2004 by the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) in collaboration with the Canadian museum community, and will provide museums with an understanding of the link between visits to the virtual space and to the physical space, enabling them to develop front-end and back-end content and means for audience engagement relevant to their visitors' needs."

The paper concludes with a look forward to the concept of virtual repatriation between countries and inter-organizational 'sharing' of artifacts between museums."

We aim to describe and evaluate an ecological approach to understanding museums and to examine information and cultural ecologies as analytical tools for guiding the design of interactive systems. We focus on two related concepts of ecology, cultural ecology (Bell 2002) and information ecology (Nardi and O'Day 1999). Utilizing each of the two frameworks, we analyze observational and interview data we collected during the research for an ambient intelligent museum guide. We also discuss the design implications of our analysis. In this paper we found that an ecology framework is highly appropriate for representing the complexities of activities, relationships, technologies and people connected to museums. We also found the information ecologies framework to guide design decisions in the creating of our interactive prototype."

Thus the accessibility of museum websites is as important as the accessibility of their premises and services. This paper presents the results of an audit of 125 museum websites, 100 in England and a group of 25 museums from around the world as a comparison group. The technical accessibility of the websites was assessed against the WCAG1 checkpoints using the accessibility tool WebXM(tm). In addition, the extent to which disabled people could use the websites was assessed by a panel of 15 people with disabilities (5 blind people, 5 partially sighted people and 5 people with dyslexia) who undertook two simple tasks on each website and rated the site on a number of dimensions. The results of the automated testing showed that only 30% of English museum websites and 20% of the international group could meet even the most basic accessibility criteria. The user testing showed that disabled people could successfully complete very basic tasks on the websites only 76.2% of the time and got lost on over one third of the sites. However, further analyses showed that these problems were originating from a relatively small number of accessibility issues that are not especially complex to address."

Converging content on the Web for Library and Archives Canada means being: proactive, engaging, discovery-oriented, e-democracy based, freely accessible and truly convergent in attitude. The Web medium provides an unprecedented technology to make content accessible. However, cultural institutions run the real risk of becoming virtual \"ivory towers.\" The technology can only be used to its fullest potential when we make the appropriate, non-virtual convergences in mentality and practice. Converging content not only means bringing together knowledge digitally, but also bringing together all cultural and knowledge-based institutions in the development of, and interaction with, this content."

    "abstract": "A map, some engravings, the records of a vanished city ... neglected artists, scattered works, and a compelling story to tell: these words describe two recent projects undertaken by the Educational Technologies Center (ETC) at Princeton University. In the first instance, a decade-long collaboration between Kirk Alexander and John Pinto, Professor of Architectural History, had resulted in an interactive exploration of Rome using Giambattista Nolli's 1748 map of the city as interface to a database of images and text. When Professor Pinto suggested using Nolli's map to contextualize Piranesi's etchings of Rome, the challenge was to combine the digitized works of two of the 18th century's greatest graphic artists to recreate a view of 18th century Rome. The most recent version, discussed here, extends the simple database queries to a Flash visualization which reveals the relationships between Piranesi's prints and the monuments they depict. In the second instance, Lionel Gossman, Professor Emeritus of Romance Languages and Literature, wished to explore the works of the German Nazarene artists. These painters enjoyed enormous popularity in the early 19th century, but had since fallen from favor, and their works had never enjoyed a comprehensive viewing. The possibility of displaying the work of these artists seemed beyond the practical scope of a museum exhibition. ETC designed an interface in which Professor Gossman's narration provided the intellectual context for an exploration of the life and works of this group of artists as a geographically disparate group of art works are examined. In both cases, the combined interaction of scholarship and technology has resulted in the virtually impossible becoming virtual reality."

Key Ingredients: America by Food was created by Museums on Main Street, a partnership of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) and the Federation of State Humanities Councils. The project includes a unique educational Web site that features a timeline of American eating titled 500 Years of American Food. Visitors to this section of the site can explore the rich diversity of American food culture by a wide variety of interesting topics including regions of the country, time periods in American history, and food related themes. But the most interesting feature of the Key Ingredients Web site is the fact that it is designed to continue to grow and expand exponentially throughout the five-year tour of the exhibition. The site has two major sections that contained little information when the site was launched in the spring of 2003, but which continue to be populated with new content. As the five identical copies of the exhibit travel to 150 small museums across the country, the Web site will continue to offer new content and a valuable resource for the museums, visitors to the museums and anyone interested in food who has Internet access."

The early pioneers of the internet created an open environment where users and developers freely shared ideas. This open and non-exclusive philosophy guided many of the successful innovations of the World Wide Web. The federal government has continued this egalitarian philosophy and, in 1998, the U.S. Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 was then enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. But what does that mean to users of the internet? To government agencies? To the creative community?"

    "abstract": "Scholarly researchers bring a unique set of expectations to bear upon the building of databases in a university museum environment. Their investigations on species distributions, biodiversity and climate change, to name a few, require analysis of large sets of data. The creation of on-line interfaces to collections databases, complete with sophisticated Web-based tools, will empower researchers to convert raw data into new scientific knowledge. The University of Alberta Museums has developed an innovative Web interface to one of its museum databases, providing researchers tools to facilitate, the generation of not only entomological specimen data held in the database, but also dynamically generated seasonal histograms, the ability to plot search results on a map, and the presentation of knowledge summaries of entomological species. This paper discusses how the University of Alberta Museums, in conjunction with other departments on campus, develops this type of enhanced Web interface to collections databases. This initiative will be explained within the context of the University of Alberta Museums' unique decentralized administrative model."

The exhibition was based on the interactive, physical exhibition Burarra Gathering: Sharing Indigenous Knowledge, which was Questacon's first Indigenous-based exhibition. The two exhibitions show some of the traditional technologies of the Burarra (\"bur-ah-da\") people of remote central north Arnhem Land, in Australia's Northern Territory. Both Burarra exhibitions were developed in co-operation with, and the approval of, the Burarra Elders. This paper will briefly outline the development of the physical exhibition and examine in more detail the on-line version. The Burarra Gathering Online development team faced many challenges, including a limited budget, the logistics of having to seek incremental approvals from Burarra Elders in remote communities 4 000 km away, and the usual technical issues these projects involve. Evaluation of the finished products has shown them to be effective in presenting Indigenous technologies in a contemporary context; they have received praise from the Burarra people and many other organizations around the world. The development processes and resulting exhibitions have shown that a close partnership with an Indigenous community can lead to insightful exhibitions that share Indigenous knowledge with the world."

Over 80 responses were received as a result of the call for submissions; these were initially the subject of a broad-based review as they were catalogued and descriptions of the evaluation projects made accessible on-line to the wider cultural community. Although the scope of the submissions received was not as wide as it might have been, many reports received were of a high standard, meaning that further, detailed analysis was possible. In October 2003, a second stage of research was completed; this explored the potential for proposing common methodologies and user profiles for use in evaluation projects. This paper describes the research in more detail, identifying key issues arising from the research and proposing a way forward for establishing a shared understanding of best practice for evaluation projects within the digital cultural sector."

In addition, the project will produce recommendations outlining how the museum sector in Scotland can best realise the potential of ICT for e-learning. The World Wide Web and other digital means (e.g. CD ROM) offer Scottish museums the opportunity to increase access for a wide range of new audiences and to promote new learning styles. In particular, opportunities are created for study by those physically remote from museum collections - from primary and secondary schools through to community and special needs groups, to self-directed lifelong learners."

Northern Journeys incorporates the interpretation of museum objects into classroom activities to support Alaskan and national content standards. Northern Journeys' intention is to teach about Alaska through the disciplines of art, culture, history, and science. Museum objects offer multiple perspectives for these disciplines and so encourage users to learn more about differing local values and traditions as they develop a sense of who they are within the community. For subjects such as Alaskan History, the Museum objects and their interpretations represent important examples of historical events, creating a visual textbook. Developed in partnership with elementary school teachers and produced with the aid of rural educators and cultural institutions, Northern Journeys embodies the practice of community curation."

Collections information in the form of text-based records, quantitative data and digital images is available on most museum Web Sites, either dynamically generated in response to user queries or in static presentation formats. Typically, this information is provided through a Web interface to a collections information management system. At the National Museum of Australia, we approached the implementation of a new collections information management system as an opportunity to create an engaging Web interface that not only presented the collection, but use contextualized the objects within a broader knowledge base of Australian history using a range of primary and secondary source material. Working with the vendor of our collections system (KE EMu) and a Web development company (Massive Interactive) with expertise in interface design, we developed a browsing tool to make the most of the museum's digital knowledge assets. The interface is designed to build information relationships based on user queries and click pathways and to present the information in a way which encourages further searching. The interface is highly visual and intuitive, supporting a model of serendipitous searching that offers multiple pathways through the relationships of people, places, objects and events that make up the complex weave of social history."

    "abstract": "Museums have a way to go in understanding what has long been apparent to commercial sites: you don't have to sweat it out over all your content if you are prepared to allow visitors to generate it for you. eBay and Friends Reunited have sites entirely built on user-generated content, and Amazon is increasingly leaning on users to develop content that adds depth and vitality. Museums can learn lessons from this approach. At the V&A we aim to be the Number One museum Web site for art and design, and our curators are world experts in their fields. In these circumstances it would be easy for the site to communicate in one direction only, but we are keen to ensure the site works in both directions and that we draw on the expertise and enthusiasm of visitors as well. We also want visitors to our Web site to feel they can contribute to the work of the museum and develop their own creativity. We have not yet persuaded a curator to moderate a chat room or ventured into any of those other potentially labour intensive Web activities, but in the last year we have used a wide variety of ways of incorporating visitor-created content into our Web site."

    "abstract": "The National Center was launched in 1997 to take the resources of the American Museum of Natural History directly to classrooms, informal science learning centers, and homes throughout the country. Initial efforts of this program included complete Web site experiences such as Biodiversity Counts, a nine-week middle school science curriculum. Evaluation indicated that teachers preferred to integrate select pieces of the curriculum into their existing lesson plans rather than adopt the entire curriculum. Our challenge was to keep content like Biodiversity Counts useful and available to our audience while minimizing our content development and maintenance costs. In that context, the concept for Resources for Learning emerged. Resources for Learning presents a collection of educational materials that anyone can browse or search for content to augment some learning activity. The project has established a new content-development methodology for the National Center. When a new Museum hall or exhibit opens, we produce a range of content resources and present them in a \"special collection\" tied to the exhibit. We can scale new content development according to available time and money, and the modular content we produce can be reused in a range of new and different contexts. Evaluation has shown that teachers find the modular content easier to appropriate and integrate into their classroom work. Future developments include a more visual display of resources to better convey the qualities of the content, and ways for visitors to collect and organize favorite resources."

The MUSE technology is currently applied to three cultural contexts: Il Museo e Certosa di San Martino - a primary institution dedicated to the history and the artistic traditions of the city of Naples, the Institute and Museum of the History of Science in Florence, and the archeological site of Pompeii. This paper discusses the evaluation of the mobile context-aware multimedia version of the application developed for the Museum and Charterhouse of San Martino. The main goal of our research is to evaluate: i) general user satisfaction; ii) the multimedia content design (i.e., the soundness of the different media and contents in different situations within the museum); iii) the ergonomy of WHYRE® (i.e., how comfortable users felt in using the mobile device); iv) the usability of the navigation and interaction design (focusing, in particular, on those aspects that are peculiar to context-aware mobile systems, such as the understandability of the context-aware behavior and the effectiveness of a multi-modal approach). Evaluation has been carried out using two complementary methods: questionnaire-based user testing (involving representative samples of end users) and heuristic inspection (performed by usability experts and based on the MiLE evaluation technique."

    "abstract": "The use of the term virtual is commonly associated with the idea of an extension of reality. Similarly, the expression virtual museum is usually adopted to mean a process of duplication of a physical museum and its objects, enabled by information technologies. Therefore, virtual museum has become a useful synonym for multimedia products or Web sites capable of providing new and fresh experiences of a specific museum and its heritage. However, in order to understand and explore further opportunities, profound reflection is necessary. We need to question and investigate the contemporary role of the museum, and then challenge this by producing innovative visions, solutions, and technological experimentation. In what ways do new technologies enhance the collective and relational nature of the museum? What cultural role and significance can physical artifacts assume in the digital age? Can a virtual museum promote the social dimension of a new, digital creativity linked to actual cultural artifacts? This paper aims to respond to these questions and to identify new forms of virtuality for the museum, focusing on the ideas of territory, local community, and collective memory. The presentation of some exemplary projects will contribute both to the evolution of the idea of virtual museum and to the use of information technologies."

    "abstract": "In October, 2000, the Space Science Institute of Boulder, Colorado, launched MarsQuest: a 5000 square foot traveling exhibit on Mars and Mars science. Two years later NSF and NASA gave their support to an associated Web project called MarsQuest Online, a partnership between TERC, the Space Science Institute, and JPL. The goal of the MarsQuest Online project was to create a Web site that extended both the reach and scope of the traveling exhibit. The program was premised on the idea that the effort expended on the museum exhibit - the exhibit framework, interactive concepts, educational goals, etc. - could be leveraged into a highly interactive on-line experience. While still in development, the site (http://www.marsquestonline.org) has already been quite successful on a variety of fronts. It provides a wide variety of activities, from 3D flyovers to drivable rovers, reflecting the learning goals of the original exhibit. We've also found that selected interactives, repackaged into a stand-alone kiosk piece, can be popular in small venues (for instance, the local planetarium during the recent Mars opposition). This paper will discuss the evolution of the project, our successes (and challenges) in attempting to leverage from a physical exhibition, and the ongoing evaluation program. The evaluation, which includes interviews, database driven usage tracking, and log analysis, will test not only the usability of the site, but also its effectiveness in meeting our educational goals as compared to the original MarsQuest exhibit."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the vision of publishing museum collections on the Semantic Web. It is shown how museums with their semantically rich and interrelated content could start creating large, consolidated semantic collection portals together on web. By semantic web techniques, it is possible to make collections semantically interoperable and provide the museum visitors with intelligent, content-based search and browsing services. The idea and its challenges are addressed through a real-world case study and implementation: the prototype of MuseumFinland, a semantic portal for Finnish museums to publish their collections on the Semantic Web. The main goals and features of MuseumFinland are: Global view to distributed collections. It is possible to use the collections of all museums participating in the system as if the collections were in a single uniform repository. In MuseumFinland, data from different collections in Finland is collected into a global repository that is made syntactically and semantically interoperable by a special transformation and annotation system. Uniform view to different kind of collections. It should be possible to merge collections of different kind in the same semantic space. In MuseumFinland, the collections in research focus include cultural artifact collections from different museums, paintings and graphics from art collections, and a database of protected heritage locations and buildings situated in the nature and urban environment. Content-based information retrieval for human usage. Since we are dealing with semantic content, the system should support intelligent information retrieval based on content concepts, not on simple keyword string match as is customary on the WWW. For example, since Helsinki is a part of Finland, the locational keyword \"Finland\" should match not only \"Finland\" but also \"Helsinki\". Semantically linked contents. A most interesting aspect of the collection items to the end-user are the implicit semantic relations relating collection data with their context and to each other. For example, assume that a painting in an art museum depicts a castle and the collection of another museum includes artifacts from there. If the user views the painting, then he could be interested in having a look at the actual artifacts stored in another museum database. In MuseumFinland, the system designer can define the notion of \"interesting associations\" in terms of generic logical predicates that make use of the underlying ontologies and collection metadata. Based on the predicates, the actual links are generated. Easy local content publication. One of the key drivers behind the success of the WWW is the ease of content publication. Everybody can publish content easily and independently by just maintaining HTML files in a local public directory. The portal will be demonstrated at the conference. Research Consortium The museums participating in the project include the National Board of Antiquities, the Espoo City Museum, the Foundation of the Helsinki University Museum, and the Antivaria Group consisting of some 20 additional Finnish museums. The project team also includes two major multi-national companies, Nokia Corp. and TietoEnator Corp in addition to the University of Helsinki and the Helsinki Institute of Information Technology. The research is mainly funded by the National Technology Agency of Finland (Tekes). Related papers, references, and more info: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/eahyvone/publications/semwebpapers.html."

This paper is a look at two exciting projects -- The Smithsonian National Museum of American History's exhibition America on the Move and the Peabody Essex Museum's ARTscape -- that go beyond the inquiry-retrieval model of an on-line collection as an end in itself, to one that provides the foundation for dynamic, extensible and diverse interactive offerings. While it is possible to add objects to and edit metadata in a collection database, most interpretive presentations are fixed programs that are difficult to modify. What if the same kind of browser-based administrative tools that are used to easily update collections could be modified to enable museum staff to curate, annotate, paginate and publish custom collections? Imagine curated collections, new stories, tours, on-line exhibitions, and media-rich presentations easily being added without involving designers, programmers or developers! When the dynamic collection and the storytelling tools are integrated, audiences benefit even more than the storytellers. Visitors can even create their own exhibits."

    "year": "2004",
    "abstract": "Visitors to the Smithsonian Museum of American History's September 11 (2001) exhibit, which closed on July 6, 2003, were invited to record their memories of September 11 either in writing or in recorded telephone messages. Some of those written messages were displayed in several locations throughout the exhibit. All of these memories, written and recorded will be made available through The September 11 Digital Archive http://911digitalarchive.org, where they join other writings prompted at that site. This intermingling of contributed memories, written texts and recorded messages, left at the physical museum and at the virtual site (not directly an arm of the Smithsonian), provides a rich field for study. In this paper, I will share a rhetorical analysis of writings left by visitors to the Smithsonian Museum of American History's September 11 (2001) exhibit, comparing these to memories recorded at the September 11 Digital Archive (http://911digitalarchive.org/) . These writings, private memories recorded to become part of public discourse displayed on a museum wall or an Internet site, serve as a memorial to the lives, and a way of life, lost that day. More than words, however, their visual presence and even suppositions as to the writers' exigency(ies), common yet very personal, and purposes for writing/sharing their memories are all fruit for rhetorical study. Beyond that I will explore the actual shift from the writings being created as a result visitor (physical or virtual space) to the writings becoming artifacts within the exhibit. More than simply an outlet for memories and volatile emotions, the writings become much of the meat in the digital archive, drawing more visitors. This sort of uber-interactivity makes the virtual museum space a constantly evolving exhibit, with visitors having a greater ownership than ever before."

    "abstract": "Three years ago, Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM) started considering wireless technology and hand held computers as a means for delivering object information to visitors. At that time SAAM was in the early stages of planning the Luce Foundation Center for American Art, a study storage facility that would showcase thousands of objects from the permanent collection normally stored off site, allowing the visiting public to see objects that normally would not be on view. Since the display style planned for the Luce Center would not accommodate extended labels, the hand held solution seemed like a good way to support and enrich the visitor experience. SAAM determined it was necessary to conduct at least one pilot program to test software applications and a variety of educational elements that might be appropriate for the small hand held screen. The Renwick Gallery, a department of SAAM with its own building and collection of contemporary craft, was selected as the test site. A wireless network was installed and content was developed for 14 of the 70 objects in the four permanent collection galleries. In fall of 2002, the Consortium for Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI) selected the Renwick Hand Held Education Project as a test bed for HandScape, a research and documentation effort supported by Intel Corporation. Through HandScape SAAM had the benefit of collaborating with Dr. Geri Gay, Director of the Human Computer Interaction Group at Cornell University. Dr. Gay and her research associate, Kirsten Boehner, helped SAAM gather and assess visitor feedback to determine what was working well and what could be improved. This has helped SAAM tremendously in its effort to fine tune a system that will work well in the Luce Center, which will open to the public in July 2006. Phase I of the Renwick Hand Held Education Project was very well received by the public, and SAAM learned a great deal from the visitor feedback. Phase II will be implemented soon, to test a different software application and respond to visitor suggestions from Phase I."

The Quilt Index spans eras and collections to provide first-of-its-kind access to information and images of quilts, an original American art form. From a Civil War-era family graveyard quilt, to countless variations on a hexagon theme, to an original contemporary design of Elvis, the Quilt Index offers preservation and access in a central, searchable database managed through an on-line, distributed ingestion system  the MATRIX Digital Repository (Repos). This Repository is built on open source database software and designed to facilitate remote records management by each participating archive through partner-specific Web browser interfaces. This paper reviews Quilt Index development and deployment, including standardization of controlled vocabulary for quilt description metadata, distributed database development, coordination with multiple partners and their varying requirements for catalogue description, digitization planning, pilot collection ingestion and modification, searching and display development from the database, records maintenance and future planning."

    "abstract": "On-line exhibitions are complex undertakings that serve the needs of diverse audiences. Users range from general interest visitors with little knowledge of the subject, to teachers looking for supporting materials for classrooms, to amateur scholars using the site as a research tool. With effective coordination, the same on-line exhibition can support these multiple roles. Three elements are important for this coordination: layered content, multiple points of entry, and connecting storylines. Layered content divides the exhibition content into several distinct tiers. Multiple points of entry give direct access to these distinct layers of content. And third, connecting storylines allow visitors to follow a theme or topic between the tiers. On-line exhibition organizers can use this multiple-tier approach to produce better-coordinated on-line content that meets the ever-increasing expectations of ever-more sophisticated audiences."

    "abstract": "Can virtual library and museum collections offer significant advantages over traditional physical displays? Clearly there are benefits in avoiding the natural temporal and spatial limitations of physical collections: location, opening hours, display space; but what other opportunities do new technologies offer? Can such collections overcome the problems that traditional curatorial/cataloguing taxonomies sometimes present for users? Can they ever be a viable alternative to the physical, or do they serve a different or complementary purpose? How important is the physical, tactile nature of artefacts to the user? This paper outlines the processes involved in the creation of three virtual resources at the University of Aberdeen: an on-line museum collection, and two library projects that focus on specific aspects of the region's history. It details how these resources were enhanced by the careful use of new technologies. The authors argue that virtual spaces can indeed complement traditional collections if properly researched, resourced and designed. Moreover, the virtual world can present exciting opportunities for placing materials in new contexts where meaningful relationships can be drawn. The authors contend that in addition to widening access for traditional audiences, virtual collections may also enable access for a different demographic; one that would not normally use libraries or museums."

    "year": "2004",
    "abstract": "While technological advances provide new preservation and dissemination practices for African archives, they rely largely on internationally developed standards for digitisation and prioritisation of material. What that means is African concerns relating to Intellectual Property, community property and access to technology, as well as connection to global forums, are largely ignored: technology is controlled by trans-national organizations off the African continent. Issues such as global homogeny focus the world on the West- its practices, icons and language. Multi-lingualism for Web-based media and digitisation/ transcription procedures for languages other than English remain under-developed and under-prioritised. In short, there are concerns that are specific to the African continent which are not being addressed on a global level. Through the Centre for Popular Memory's (CPM's) audio visual archive and the collection of narratives of urban terror and power relations in the diasporas, these concerns are explored with relation to digitisation procedures, storage mediums/customised digital repositories, and virtual archives in a global context."

Tate Online currently attracts in excess of 2 million visitors a year, and independent analysis confirms it is the most popular UK art Web site. Visitors to the site are diverse (comprising artists, students, academics, members, patrons, tourists, job applicants, journalists and government officials) and have distinct information needs. Almost every department across Tate now contributes content to Tate Online, targeting different audiences in different ways. Planning is fundamental to the successful development of the site, and is taken forward by the centrally located Digital Programmes department. As part of this planning, we have identified and communicated the key areas for focus over the next 3-5 years, and are beginning to profile and target better the different audience groups the organisation is endeavouring to attract. This paper will suggest some of the methods we are employing to balance the demands, in an effort to ensure that both visitor numbers and visitor satisfaction increase in line with Tate's overall objectives."

    "abstract": "The year 2004 will mark the 5-year anniversary of the RFP for a new version of Making Sense of Modern Art (MsoMA) -- a Flash-based, kiosk- and CD-compatible Web program that includes a Web-based authoring and publishing tool component \"Pachyderm\" to enable its ongoing development. In those years, we have seen the rise and fall of the dot-com tsunami, the loss of one of our primary consulting partners, and the brief eclipse of our own program as economic hard times hit home. Now, thanks to bridge funding from outside sources and a major IMLS online leadership grant, we have been able to expand Making Sense of Modern Art to its full anticipated scope, with in-depth treatment of artworks from Matisse's Femme au chapeau (1905) to Louise Bourgeois's Nest (1994), a full and varied set of conceptual Comparisons Across Time, and Themes including \"Artists as Rulebreakers\" and \"Self and Society.\" From the beginning, we understood Making Sense as a new way of writing art history: it was conceived as a living, multi-level approach to artworks through video and a variety of interactive screen types that mirror ways of understanding visual objects. Over the years, the program's development has necessitated the creation of a set of processes and procedures for research, asset management, rights negotiation/tracking, and media production. This paper/presentation will both describe the technical systems we have developed and demonstrate the rich content outcomes that have resulted from more than four years of sustained effort. It will also describe three current outgrowths of the Making Sense of Modern Art program: a dedicated MSoMA curriculum site meshing with California standards currently under development with teacher-collaborators the authoring and publishing tool Pachyderm which, thanks to a recently announced grant from the IMLS, will be revised in collaboration with a network of college and university New Media Centers and then be offered freely to museums for their own future use discovery tools and new interfaces developed for SFMOMA's website and its new Koret Visitor Education Center, providing easy access to the rich resources of SFMOMA's multimedia programs, most notably Making Sense and its offshoots, which were all initially programmed in metadata-resistant Flash 4 and 5!"

    "year": "2004",
    "abstract": "Every work of storytelling, play, film, novel, opera, musical, is characterized by the development of a plot in which characters embody certain roles, establish certain relationships, evolve their feelings, generate and get affected by events. It is a world populated by several possible levels of interpretation often difficult to follow. The delivery of narration-intensive media becomes everyday more common on the Internet where the Web provides a more interruptible and fragmented way of interacting with them, making their comprehension even more difficult than usual. We present an XML Schema defining a language (XNDL XML Narrative Description Language) dedicated to describe the time-based evolution of roles, relationships, events and consequences within a narration. An XNDL file can be fed into a'plot visualization and discovery tool' able to render a graphical representation of it through vector graphics, where stylized shapes, colors, size, arrows etc. all concur to simplify and explain what's going on. Why did that character act like this? Wasn't she supposed to be friend with this other, why are they fighting now? And how's she feeling, uh I see, she's marked as'betrayed' Did I miss something? And what's the relationship between those others: are they friends, lovers, is one of them taking advantage of the other? Such a tool can be used stand-alone or even be synchronized with the timed delivery of the media it refers to. There are several scenarios we foresee for both the Schema and the tool, from the obvious educational ones, to the cross-exploration possibilities a codified version of the plots would provide (how Verdi's La Traviata, Dumas' La dame aux camellias and the Greek myth of Orpheus relate to the movie Moulin Rouge?), to being provided as a stream of information on iTV channels."

This paper reports on an on-line survey that explored the latter question by focusing very specifically on issues of motivation. Why do people visit a museum Web site, and how do these motivations affect their experience with the site, and the learning or meaning-making that may happen as a result of their visit? By understanding the links between motivation and meaning-making, museum professionals will be able to provide more effective and more enriching on-line experiences for their visitors."

    "year": "2004",
    "abstract": "With a newly energized commitment to young audiences, The Museum of Modern Art has recently developed two Web sites, one for young children ages 5 to 8, and the other directed towards teenagers. In the process, the Museum's Educators and the Digital Media team who collaborated on these projects used the opportunity to bring in the voices and ideas of children and teens, to introduce the curatorial staff to some new playful approaches to the collections, and finally to explore how the resources developed for these sites might interface with other agendas within the Museum. This paper will focus primarily on the development of the teen site, while using both sites to demonstrate modes of audience input, the development of software for multiple purposes, and strategies for marketing sites to young audiences.' The Teen site, called 'Red Studio' after Matisse's famous painting, was premised on the notion that teens are excited by direct and immediate contact with working artists, even artists whose work is quite complex. The site will eventually include a collection of 'features', focusing on a diverse array of artists whose work is in MoMA's collection. Working with a small group of teenagers from local high schools, most of whom had participated in the Museum's programs previously, the project began with a study of Vito Acconci, who the students studied, met and ultimately interviewed on camera. The site includes an interactive interview section, comprised of video clips of the teen interview with Acconci, related topics, questions and polls for soliciting teen response, in addition to a glossary, and a visual timeline of the artist's work. Running parallel to this exploration of the artist and his work is a competition in which teens are invited to participate by creating and submitting their own design for an art project that is related to Acconci's work. The site provides a set of contest parameters, online design tools, and a space for each competitor to articulate his or her explanation for the submission. (Acconci, curatorial and Education staff will judge the competition.) Red Studio marks the Museum's deepening commitment to teen audiences, their need for participatory activities, and their strong sense of connection to the unexpected and challenging aspects of contemporary art. The question of how to create a Web site with and for teens that also speaks to the needs and responsibilities of this international museum are central themes that will be explored in this paper."

    "year": "2004",
    "abstract": "Cloth & Clay: Communicating Culture is an online exhibition developed by the Textile Museum of Canada and the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art. Wide in scope, Cloth & Clay explores over 2,000 years of Mexican, Central and South American history, introducing ancient and contemporary objects and the people who made them to a global audience. The online environment brings the two museum collections together in an interactive and visually enticing environment not possible in a traditional museum gallery. Cloth & Clay is a vast information resource that maximizes the exploratory, unrestricted nature of the Web. Careful information architecture, which refers to the structuring and prioritization of content, and quality overall design combine to produce the very language of storytelling online. Every object in Cloth & Clay has a story to tell. Multiple paths of discovery lend multiple voices to the object's storytellers, enhancing the presentation and broadening its audience appeal. The Cloth & Clay Website was created over a one-year period, and it offers a model for other institutions hoping to achieve meaningful museological expression online. At the time of the launch of the online exhibit on the Virtual Museum of Canada Website in October 2002, a temporary physical exhibition also opened at the Textile Museum of Canada using some of the objects, interpretive materials, and design elements in the online exhibition. We will outline the model we developed to create this product -- which involved cutting edge audience research, unique curatorial perspective, indigenous consultation and contribution, academic advisors, institutional collaboration and managing technology -- at the Museums and the Web 2004 conference. We invited a group of target users to help with the design of the site through front-end concept testing, formative evaluation of the prototype Teacher Resources section, and summative evaluation comparing the online and on-site exhibition experience. We will focus on the Summative Evaluation phase of our audience research. Participants had previously responded to the objects, design, and teachers materials for the Website and completed a participant questionnaire. Audience research included observation of participants behaviours in the exhibition compared with casual visitors also visiting at the time, and a Focus Group in the gallery. In addition, we analyzed responses to a brief, written and self-administered exit questionnaire for all visitors to the Cloth and Clay exhibition, which included a question about visiting the exhibition's Website. As small to medium-sized institutions, we wish to show by example the great potential the Web has for museums of any size to reach out in meaningful ways to a wide audience. The creation of the Cloth & Clay Web site has had a significant impact on each partner institution, encouraging new investments in each museum's technological infrastructure and raising awareness among staff of the great potential for museums in this medium. The CD-ROM version of Cloth & Clay: Communicating Culture won the 2003 AAM Museum Publications Design Competition for CD-ROMs / Budget above $500,000. The 2003 winners of the Best of the Web competition based on Museum Web sites from around the world included Cloth and Clay in the list of five finalists (retrieved from http://www.archimuse.com/mw2003/best/final_virtual.html)."

Using innovations in multimedia technology, student and adult audiences can make personal connections to visual art and museum artifacts through new ways of storytelling. Digital storytelling is a new medium for this age-old practice and one that is humanistic, culturally rich, and globally relevant. This paper will review the pedagogical dimensions of a digital storytelling tutorial for K-12 teachers that took place at the National Gallery of Art's Teacher Institute in the summer of 2003. It will also examine how the concepts presented have been translated into real-world experience in Chicago public schools. The value of digital storytelling - for teachers and for museums - will be addressed through the perspectives of the museum educator who organized the Institute, a language arts teacher who served as a technology coach, and a program enrollee who develops on-line educational resources for Chicago public schools."

New pilot programs are under way at Tate Modern, Te Papa Tongarewa, The Royal Institute, and several other sites in Europe, North America and Asia. In these and other locations, the handheld installations are moving well beyond the traditional adult tour and are being used for way finding, chat rooms, bookmarking, disabled visitor access, and interactive family tours. Over the past 12 months there has been a tremendous amount of progress that has moved the wireless handheld platform from the theoretical realm into the practical for museum guides. Third generation user-interfaces are more intuitive, battery issues have been resolved, and museum touring applications have been tested and proven to be stable and effective. This paper looks at the new applications for this platform and describes representative handheld programs at five museums."

    "abstract": "Museums have traditionally used timelines as a means of creating narratives of historical, cultural, political, geographical and social change. However, such timelines are only one aspect of a potential infinity of semantic continua, and fail to exploit fully the possibilities implicit in the objects that exemplify them. In this paper we describe the 'Gernsback Machine', a novel categorisation and navigation model based on principles of facet analysis that enables descriptive metadata terms to be located within a fully navigable universal facet tree. The navigation potential of 'step, flip or zoom' inherent in the GM permits exploration through all semantic continua, and, by allowing the users to follow their own particular threads, enables complex narrative structures to be created. We describe how the Gernsback Machine can be used to create a virtual museum space for new or existing collections, using a series of recursively defined 'bento' containers to define the museum content. We describe how our prototype illustrates the potential of the GM in exploring different aspects of the time facet, in a 'museum of the history of possible futures and probable pasts'."

    "abstract": "The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum technology staff built a Web interface for distance learning programs using Macromedia Flash. Using this technology, staff in the Museum could connect with groups such as teachers and students in a classroom and bring programs outside the Museum's walls. This technology is capable of synchronous (live) and asynchronous video and audio; for the asynchronous element, there is a component built in that allows PowerPoint presentations, film clips, Web sites, and photos to be shown to the group which the Museum staff member is addressing. As a member of the Education division staff at the Museum, I was asked to manage and coordinate the testing of this technology with teachers and students, and other groups as appropriate. This paper describes our process of testing and some of the programs that we held - those that worked and those that did not. It also discusses some of the challenges we faced, such as getting staff to buy-in on the technology and the quality of the programs, and what changes we would like to make for the coming year. We are still testing this technology and will be doing more programming over the coming year. We hope to add to our menu of technology options this year, and to improve the Web interface that we designed."

It is potentially beneficial to researchers and practitioners in the emerging area of documentary Web work, and for museums or cultural institutions who utilize Web sites for exhibition programming and thematic presentations. The goal of the paper is to develop a methodological framework for analyzing Web documentaries based on current film theory, since to date, documentary practice has been rooted in filmmaking. A secondary goal is to describe the current state of Web documentaries as well as potential benefits and hurdles in its future development. A review of potentially relevant film theories assists in building a framework for analyzing documentary practices on the Internet. The framework proposed is based on Bill Nichol's theory of documentary film. The study includes analysis of five documentary Web sites ranging from independently to institutionally produced sites. Our aim is to contribute to further investigations of the relationship between documentary cinema and documentary practices on the Internet."

    "abstract": "The King's Kunstkammer is an interactive on-line exhibition that aims to create a virtual reunification of a now-dissolved Renaissance collection and to demonstrate the principle of collecting and classification. The on-line exhibition is based on the original Danish Royal Kunstkammer which was established around 1650 by King Frederik III as one of several European collections, arranged and organised according to the Renaissance ideas of a cross disciplinary profusion. In 1825, the 10,000 objects were dispersed to the newly established specialised museums of art, history and natural sciences. In The King's Kunstkammer, about 250 of these objects are reunited and \"placed\" in the original 9 chambers which reflect the order of classification in the Kunstkammer. In the interactive part the user can create a personal exhibition from the objects in The King's Kunstkammer. In a virtual museum the user can pick up objects in storage and place them in the showcases in the exhibition rooms. In storage the objects are partly organised in boxes in an untraditional way, e.g. shiny things, round things. And in a true virtual museum, one object can of course be found in more than one box! The finished exhibition is saved at the Web site for 30 days, a catalogue can be printed out, and other guests are invited to see already existing exhibitions. A visitors' book serves as a communication device between exhibitors and for general comments. Finally, The King's Kunstkammer has a comprehensive hypertext presentation of the story of and the ideas behind Renaissance collections."

Many museums' Web sites include a kids' section, either as a separate website (such as the J@rdin des jeunes branchs at the Montreal Botanical Garden) or a corner dedicated to fun activities and interactive learning (such as the Canada Science and Technology Museum). In an educational environment, content-enriched Web sites should be designed to be user-centered taking into consideration this young audience. Situated cognition of kids applied to the Web reveals important aspects in the design and evaluation of educational Web sites. Concurrent review of available literature, analysis of ergonomic criteria applied to kids' Web sites and usability studies with children demonstrate the need for a better consensus on the way we develop and evaluate the user-interface of online products for children. An integrated and iterative model is proposed to bring a structured and analytical perspective on kids' Web sites that can be applied to museum Web sites."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the process used to evaluate the design and implementation of museum-supported videoconferencing and demonstrate selected videoconference uses and outcomes for both museum educators and classroom teachers. Over the past several years, severe budget cuts and growing safety concerns have impacted the typical classroom's ability to physically access the rich resources available in museums, environmental centers, and active learning centers. Paradoxically, the mission of many museums, as reflected by their mission statements and their subsequent allocation of staff and resources, have changed to reflect a growing emphasis on service to educational settings. Project VIEW, a federally funded Technology Innovation Challenge Grant, located at Schenectady City Schools, has developed an innovative program that has as its objective the sharing of museum resources by bringing the museum to the classroom via interactive, point-to-point videoconferencing. Under this model, core groups of museum educators and teachers collaboratively develop curriculum units that integrate museum staff and supporting artifacts into classroom instruction through the use of videoconferencing via the web. In addition to designing a method of developing curriculum, the project also has designed a professional development program that trains classroom teachers and museum educators in point-to-point videoconferencing and has established a method of evaluating the efforts that support the program and the resulting outcomes to teachers and students. Utilizing a stakeholder based participatory model of evaluation, the project has been able to provide program staff, local educators, and museum teams formative and summative information on the process of designing and implementing videoconferences as well as information on the direct outcomes and systemic organizational changes that have occurred as a result of participation. A multi-phase mixed methodology approach to data collection has incorporated evaluation feedback to the design teams at three stages of development, at implementation, and post use. Data sources include observations of team collaboration, review of curriculum materials, interviews with teachers, museum educators, technology support personnel, direct observation of classroom use (both at the museum site and in the classroom) and paper-pencil surveys and interviews of participating students and classroom teachers. In addition, specialists in museum education and K-12 education provide external reviews of the curriculum and selected videoconferences. As part of this process, the evaluation effort also documents best practices in the provision of professional development for museum educators and classroom teachers. The focus of this effort is to document model methods of training museum educators and classroom teachers on the development and the use of point-to-point videoconferencing. These formative data are utilized by museum administrators and project staff to improve the preparation of curriculum and the presentation of the videoconferences; summative data are used to document long-term impact of the training and the subsequent use of collaborative videoconferencing the museum and the school."

    "abstract": "As museums throughout the world enter the interactive arena of 21st century digital communications, a need has emerged to access strategies of program development that seamlessly interface with existing missions and resources. This paper examines Project VIEW, a US Department of Education Technology Innovation Challenge Grant, that collaborates with major museums - the Guggenheim (NY) Museum, the Whitney Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, the Philadelphia Museum of Art - and other content providers - the Bronx Zoo, NASA/Space Center Houston, etc. - to create templates for developing point-to-point interactive museum-centered videoconferences along with pre- and post-conference materials designed to enhance and solidify student learning. Underlying the work of VIEW is the premise that to achieve the promise and potential of interactive technologies, it is necessary to change the construct of educational pedagogy and the structure of content for classroom instruction. In order to accomplish its ambitious program, Project VIEW employs multi-phase integration techniques that bring together the needs and missions of diverse yet intersecting educational delivery systems at museums and schools. Essential to the process is recognition of the need to assist schools in meeting educational Learning Standards without sacrificing the integrity of museum-based scholarship. Project VIEW has designed a process of needs analysis, infrastructure support, mission integration, and collaborative educational delivery that achieves unique success by facilitating the development and integration of new modes of content delivery. VIEW brings master teachers together with museum personnel to lay the foundation for a transformation and evolution of teaching pedagogy and instructional practice using interactive technologies ? point-to-point videoconferencing and asynchronous web-based resources ? to access and integrate museum content and resources into curriculum delivery in the classroom. Imbedded in these programs are interactive, student-centered activities that result in direct standards-based learning through museum content and interaction with museum educators. The interface and synergy between content providers and content receivers have produced strategies for developing both technological infrastructure and also has created a community of users. Additionally, while the development of a model for sustainable program development and content integration a core component of Project VIEW, the primary goal of VIEW is to deliver instruction that produces evidence of higher level student learning and academic performance. Interim evaluation by an external reviewer (The Evaluation Consortium) indicates evidence of enhanced student learning among students who participate in Project VIEW programs. Importantly, evidence confirms that outcomes for students are the result of VIEW training and development processes in which both schools and museums are transforming the way that they deliver education and define their through integrated, interactive videoconferencing and web-based learning."

The Teachers' Guide project sprung from the basic need to revise outdated materials, with the initial goal of providing materials for educators preparing students for a visit to the Museum. However, the entire process led to a deeper exploration and clearer articulation to our visitors of the Museum's mission, exhibits and programs. As a result, the project outcomes echoed throughout the entire institution influencing current and future programs, promotional materials and development efforts. The presentation will address the partnerships and collaboration that existed throughout the project, the process of development and evaluation, and the resulting institutional effects and lessons learned through developing a Teachers' Guide for the Museum of Tolerance. The Museum of Tolerance is a unique educational institution, which utilizes cutting edge technology together with innovative learner-centered approaches to challenge visitors to confront bias and bigotry in the world today. The project goal was to provide California teachers with the tools they need to teach the content discussed in the Museum: the power of words and images, the dynamics of discrimination, the pursuit of democracy and diversity, and the value of personal responsibility. While the project started off Californian-based, we realized it could serve educational professionals across the country and perhaps even world-wide. Our case study poses the questions: What happens when you take a museum already based on technology and build a web site? Did it hinder or help project development? How did we represent the Museum's goals and themes outside of the Museum's exhibits? The Museum of Tolerance has always challenged itself to expand on what the purpose of a museum is \"focusing on the transforming power of technology, partnerships, education and social action\" many of the issues that have become increasingly central to all Museums. The case study on the Teachers' Guide we are presenting brings these core elements to the fore. An insight to be shared is how the process led not only to an innovative product, but provided the opportunity for us to evaluate the role of the museum and to realize how a basic need could transform an institution."

A sustained consideration, beyond technological innovation, to pragmatic concerns arising from current acquisition and documentation practices and data quality is necessary. Coupled with this, a consolidated response is required to recent post-structuralist, postmodern epistemological, disciplinary and museological debates about knowledge making and meaning construction and how current collections information relates to, and revises these themes."

It is an interactive, flexible and personalized tool, which allows the Museum to give information and services to cinema fans and to all potential visitors. The aim of the project is integrating three fundamental aspects: to widen the access to the Museum heritage; to enrich the visitors experience both inside and outside the National Museum of Cinema; to give knowledge personalized tools. MultiMuseum is a highly developed platform including applications commonly used on the web, expressively customized for the communicative needs of the Museum, and specific original software, like HyperFilm, which allows to insert images, videos, QTVR, HTML pages as hyper textual links connected to a main video. The prototype deals with three experimentation areas: the advanced Web channel, characterized by a strong graphic element, including not only the presentation of the Museum and of its charming dressing, but also of the collections, of the institutional activities and of the films planning of Cinema Massimo; the PDA channel, conceived to implement the access to the contents, both inside and outside the Museum, by using handheld devices; the Reseau channel, devoted to the wide band net (VDSL) created by Telecom Italia and Telecom Italia Lab."

    "abstract": "Our exploratory research concerns the impact of the Internet on museums as well as the perception that visitors have of museums through these new information media. The rapid evolution of these technologies and their appearance in our everyday lives provokes profound changes in every domain, including museums, and raises numerous questions while permitting the creation of a new medium for learning. The principal objectives of our project, on the theoretical level, are to explore the ways Quebec art museum Web sites are used as museum educational resources for adult learning and to build a typology of the abstract learning is achieved by their adult visitors. On a practical level, we seek to draw up a list of the needs or objectives sought, record the technical difficulties encountered during their virtual visit, ascertain the intention for visiting the Web site before/after the visit to the museum itself and to draw up a profile of museum Web site users. Our methodology consists of analyzing the data from a bilingual questionnaire placed on-line on the Web sites of the 3 Quebec museums: Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal, Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, Musée du Québec with a sample group of 412 subject-respondents. The ensuing results provide Webmuseology with the first data on the users of Quebec art museum Web sites and make their needs known in a way to positively influence the creativity of the Web site designers. The major contribution of the results of this investigation lies in the revelation that the majority of the young who visit actual museums are fervent users of art museum Web sites, undoubtedly due to the enthusiasm the young have for the Internet, unlike older adults who visit the actual museums. This could resolve in part our research problem which is the low number of visitors to the actual museums since the art museum Web sites serve as a lure to attract the young to the actual museum. Our research helps inform art museum Web site designers about the needs of Internet surfers as to the importance of focusing on the development of the educational side of the site through the digitization of their collections and artistic content. As a rule, all our results enable us to affirm that the art museum Web sites promote learning for people of both sexes and of all ages, levels of education, professions and nationalities; the majority of the people who have engaged interactively with the Web sites have also visited the actual museums; for most the visit to the actual museum promotes equally the acquisition of new knowledge as well as a modest learning, irrespective of the number of visits annually to the actual museum; in most cases the visit to the art museum Web sites promotes modest learning; that the visit to other art museum Web sites promotes the acquisition of new knowledge in most cases; and that the subjects who visited the actual museum and returned to the Web site after their visit to the actual museum in order to learn more, acquired new knowledge in most cases. These results, in response to our research question: ?Can we itemize the abstract learning achieved by adults on art museum Web sites?? On top of this revelation of adult abstract learning, our research over this given period (5 months) will have permitted the identification of a socio-demographic profile of the visitors to these Web sites, which is summarized as: predominantly young women, in their twenties, with an undergraduate university degree or a college diploma, professionals or students, of Canadian nationality born in Quebec, Francophone, who visit actual museums as well as art museum Web sites more than three times a year. Most are experienced Internet users and frequently use word processors, exchange e-mails, use CD-ROMS but rarely converse on chat groups. Following interviews with the Webmasters of the three museums explored, we could perceive their interest for our research and the influence that it can exert on their projects since they do not posses yet statistics on the users of their Web sites. At present all three are redesigning their Web sites."

    "year": "2003",
    "abstract": "People developing museum websites need to avoid replicating traditional museums and creating sites that take little account of how people learn. In developing the British Galleries, the Victoria and Albert Museum identified eight audience types and their needs and four learning styles and used these to audit ideas for interpretation. 'Variety' became a key to ensuring people with a wide range of backgrounds, needs and preferred learning styles found something they could relate to in the new galleries. We now wish to apply some of the lessons learnt in developing the British Galleries to the development of the V&A website, although lack of research in the way people use museum websites to learn about objects is an obstacle. The V&A website needs more than simply collections information on the site. Using interactivity (where visitors have the power to influence outcome) and participation (where visitors can feel involved) can broaden the base of people who feel that the website has something for them that fits in with their own needs and learning styles. One means of creating variety and balance within the interactivity on the site is to provide a range of activity relating to a continuum that runs from the museum as expert through to putting the visitor in the role of expert. Examples are taken from the V&A website showing how different part of the site work. Some activities occur solely on the website and others have been generated as a combination of gallery activity and web activity. Some of the most successful events have been those where both museum and visitor have offered expertise. Other seemingly frivolous events have generated levels of creativity, commitment and enthusiasm entirely appropriate to the aims of the museum. We need to do more research and welcome collaboration with others to increase the variety of activity on our site."

    "abstract": "By inviting teachers to put on white gloves and step inside the collections, the online exhibition and interpretation process becomes most meaningful for education. Museum professionals have ideas about how teachers want to use primary objects in their classroom practice, but the reality often departs from the expectation. Involving in-service educators in the process maximizes the impact of the effort. Practicing teachers have helped The Franklin Institute Online develop an educational context for two- and three-dimensional objects from its collection of historical science artifacts. Currently, a new initiative is underway, motivated by teachers' expressed needs to personalize the historical objects. The Franklin Institute Awards program assembles case files for every nominee. To date, over two thousand case files have been created and preserved. Each case file represents a microcosmic portrait of scientific achievement. Teachers are supporting the digitization prioritization process, helping to identify the cases that have strongest value for classroom usage and connections to standards-based curriculum. The list of possibilities includes most every noteworthy scientist of the past 175 years including Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Orville Wright, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Thomas Alva Edison. Each case file includes letters, journals, diagrams, drawings, and a concise account of a life spent in service to scientific achievement."

    "abstract": "The Web's use in general promotion, showcasing permanent and temporary exhibits, and providing access to catalogs of material is well documented. Less obvious is the power of the Web to show permanent exhibits in a new light. The development of provocative online exhibits can create compelling narratives by juxtaposing objects from the permanent collection that are not usually seen together. Curators and Web developers can work together to recontextualize objects and help audiences see them and experience them differently. In addition, multiple stories can be told within the online exhibit built from the permanent collection, leveraging existing material housed as digital assets. This approach not only creates new learning opportunities for visitors, but also represents a way to recoup prior investment in digital assets management and to create new exhibits in a time of downsized budgets. In this paper, we will first describe theoretical underpinnings for creating combined online/offline exhibits based on the permanent collection, and then provide high-level practical guidance for implementing such an application. Throughout the paper, we will provide case examples of completed projects and works in progress for nationally known museums."

    "year": "2003",
    "abstract": "A museum usually talks to its audience through a variety of means, such as websites, help desks, human guides, brochures. A considerable effort is being made by museums in order to integrate these different means; for example, by creating a coherent graphic layout for digital and printed communication, or by giving the possibility to contact the human helpdesk via e-mail or chat. The website can be designed so as to be reachable or even updateable from visitors inside the museum via touch screen or wireless devices. But these efforts seem still far from reaching a real, complete integration due to the difficulty of creating a coherent and really usable interface for different means and situations. We have all experienced how difficult it is to integrate different information, coming from different sources, with different formats, inside a common frame like the website, and how difficult it is to update it continuously. Moreover, the website is simply inaccessible for computer-illiterate persons. One way to achieve a deeper integration comes from a new generation of natural language recognition systems and their user-friendly interfaces. These applications are able to understand text inputs and spoken language coming from any source (e-mail, chat, web forms, phone). After getting the input, the system will try and find the appropriate answer by applying complex interpretation rules and by searching different databases inside or outside the museum's infosphere. After the answer is found, it can be transmitted to the user by different means: web, e-mail, cell phone messages, vocal messages. Such interfaces can integrate many useful applications: museums's mascot, interactive guide, shop assistant, first level help desk, e-learning tutor and customer care. It is also easy to imagine a proactive role, e.g. with the system personally inviting people to museum events, always in a very interactive and natural way, since the system can dialogue in real time with users, getting also valuable data about their needs and desires. Is this science-fiction, particularly for low-budgeted museums? Perhaps not. It is now possible to develop powerful and easily maintainable solutions on low-cost platforms, integrating the museum's IT infrastructure with artificial intelligence based characters. They could act as a front end for natural language recognition engines, speech recognition systems, and existing database and content management applications. The paper will present these new solutions, together with the first case-histories of natural language interfaces usage. Finally, the paper will explore some of the exciting possibilities opened by the integration of these innovative means for museums and cultural institutions."

Several heterogeneous interface devices are supported including location-sensitive mobile units, on-site stationary devices, and personalized CDs that extend the on-site experience beyond the visit time thanks to personal memories gathered during the visit. The design framework is multi-layer in nature: it takes care of application design both at conceptual and implementation level. At conceptual level it supports content, navigation, interaction and presentation design. At implementation level it includes an interface-independent execution engine as well as a set of tools mapping the design into a formal interface description that specifies the run-time rules-of-behavior to the execution engine. The proposed framework is going to be demonstrated in outstanding museums and archaeological sites in Italy."

Although a foundation was laid ahead of time, the Web site was constructed on-site in a trailer as the Festival unfolded, taking in and responding to the textures, sounds, events, energy, and people that comprised the event. Building a festival site while the Festival unfolded left little room for error. But producing the site during and within the Festival brought vibrancy and immediacy that would not have been possible had the site been fully designed before the event began. The Web site was thus part of the live event, influenced and inspired by the colors of silk, sounds of music, smells of foods. As videographers and photographers documented events, pages were designed, coded, and launched. The festival brought people together from around the world. We freely and openly shared knowledge, ideas, and resources becoming an example of collaborative exchange that the Silk Road symbolizes."

A large proportion of these sites were virtual galleries and museums. Second, these same environments covered a wide array of architectural interpretations and represented some of the most cutting-edge work in the medium. It became clear that there is a relationship between galleries and virtual environments. At a fundamental level, both are information spaces. A primary difference is that the Web3D environments are bound to the computer and currently limited by mouse and screen. Factoring this in, we merge the GUI and the Gallery to create a native foundation for the development of virtual space. This paper discusses the relationship of GUI and gallery, and the impact of mouse and screen, and then showcases the exploration of several on-line virtual museums and galleries."

    "year": "2003",
    "abstract": "When museum professionals speak of evaluating a web site, they primarily mean formative evaluation, and by that they primarily mean testing the usability of the site. In the for-profit world, usability testing is a multi-million dollar industry, while in non-profits we often rely on far too few dollars to do too much. Hence, heuristic evaluation is one of the most popular methods of usability testing in museums. Previous research has shown that the ideal usability evaluation is a mixed-methods approach, using both qualitative and quantitative, expert-focused and user-focused methods. But some within the online museum field have hypothesized that heuristic evaluation alone is sufficient to recognize most usability issues. To date there has been no studies on how reliable or valid heuristic evaluation is for museum web sites. This is critical if heuristic evaluation is to be used alone rather than in tandem with other methods. This paper will focus on work being done at the Atlanta History Center as a case study for the effectiveness of heuristic evaluation in a museum web site setting. It is a project currently in the beginning stages of development. The Center is applying a thorough mixed-methods approach to evaluation, including heuristic evaluation. The results of this project will assess how complete and how useful a rigorous heuristic evaluation is alone and in conjunction with other methods in the development and implementation of an online educational resource."

    "abstract": "Shared virtual worlds are innovative applications where several users, represented by Avatars, simultaneously access via Internet a 3D space. Users co-operate through interaction with the environment and with each other, manipulating objects and chatting as they go. Apart from in the well-documented online action games industry, now often played out in real-time over the Internet, the success stories of virtual worlds and shared VRML environments have been sporadic. Interest wanes from an enthusiastic beginning: the 3D world looks both enticing and promising, but the attention curve drops sharply as the users find the space either too difficult to navigate or not satisfyingly engaging. The key to the success or failure of these environments relates directly to the content offered and the ability of the environment to hold a critical mass of users in real time. This is the desperately sought after magic social glue that determines the experience to be meaningful and actively keeps the users under its virtual spell. The paper will present an innovative project, a shared virtual world geared to schools in an educational and highly structured,environment. SEE, Shrine Educational Experience, is a co-operative project developed jointly by Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, and the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, offering a pioneering educational environment based on a shared 3D virtual world, where classes from all over the world meet in order to learn and discuss issues related to the famous Dead Sea Scrolls and the tiny community (probably of Essenes) who once lived by the Dead Sea."

    "abstract": "Interpretation for visually impaired people in art museums is dominated by an emphasis on the tactile and the physically immediate. In practice, this seemingly logical approach often keeps blind and partially sighted people at an intellectual distance from art works and their artistic context. For over-reliance on a tactile approach has the effect of making sculpture the primary vehicle for accessing art, despite the fact that \"touchable\" sculpture represents only a tiny fraction of Western art as represented in museums and galleries. Moreover, in this display context \"touchable\", by definition, means robust, indicating traditional materials such as bronze and stone. Yet like traditional narrative and figurative subject matter, bronze and stone cease to hold sway in twentieth century art. How then can someone who is congenitally blind be given intellectual access to non-tactile artworks that are not artefacts, that do not have clear descriptive relationships to objects and experiences from the lived world and that refer to and are of an about themselves only? This was the starting point for research that began four years ago at Tate Modern, London's new national museum of modern art. The latest development to come out of this on-going research is i-Map art resources for blind and partially sighted people that are delivered online. Currently i-Map explores the work of Matisse and Picasso, their innovations, influences and personal motivations, as well as key concepts in modern art. Aimed at partially sighted and blind people with a general interest in art as well as art teachers and their visually impaired pupils, i-Map incorporates text, image enhancement and deconstruction, animation and raised images. Importantly, i-Map transformed a gallery-based practice that involved intensive 1:1 delivery, into an entirely new way of deconstructing art online and one where the user has the necessary tools to work independently. Moreover, i-Map goes beyond straight description, attempts to simulate purely visual experiences and the usual focus on \"what?\" in favour of exploring the \"why?\" of art so that visually impaired users can make their own critical judgments. Visually impaired people use the Web in conjunction with screen reader software to obtain information, visually impaired people often find travel complicated and stressful, visually impaired children are usually in mainstream education and all schools in the UK are online. The process of reassessing the parameters and definitions of art education for visually impaired people revealed the Web to be an ideal vehicle for increasing intellectual access and delivering effective interpretation in a format that offers autonomy of exploration. However, in order for a project such as i-Map to confidently defy received Web design wisdom and develop tailor made solutions, it's content needs to be the product of successful methodology and focussed research. It is possible to provide blind and partially sighed people with intellectual access to any artwork and the Web offers enormous potential to do assist in this process. In attempting to achieve this, i-Map can provide useful practical and pedagogical pointers."

Why should art and artifact be any different? Some Museum Web sites provide austere library-science-like access to information, while others have documentary film-like storytelling qualities. For some curators, the Web is an opportunity to get out of the way and give visitors free access to all that is hidden in their physical museum; for others, they see the multimedia possibilities as a way to enhance their controlled presentations and add on even more interpretive accessories. Some sites provide unmediated direct access to their entire collection, while others provide carefully curated presentations. What do users want? Is the Web a tool for audiences to go beyond the exhibit walls and explore, sort and search collections themselves, or is it an opportunity for richer, more immersive interpretive presentations? In this talk we will examine a variety of museum-related sites that explore each extreme and all in between-from database-driven sites to rich-media documentary-like approaches-and evaluate what components worked and what didn't. We will look at the relative costs associated with developing either direction, and by analyzing the traffic reports and user feedback from hybrid sites that incorporate each extreme we will explore which components were ultimately more popular, which proved easier to update or maintain, and which cultivated repeat traffic."

    "abstract": "TimeMap is a unique integration of database management, metadata and interactive maps, designed to contextualise and deliver cultural data through maps. TimeMap extends conventional maps with the time dimension, creating and animating maps on-the-fly; delivers them as a kiosk application or embedded in Web pages; links flexibly to detailed content in Web pages and databases; connects to a wide variety of data sources, including textual databases and scanned historical maps, situated anywhere on the Internet; and allows locational data to be captured in a Web browser.This paper presents an overview of TimeMap, focusing on the flexible data model and metadata-based methodology which allow TimeMap to integrate seamlessly with existing databases and fulfill a wide range of application needs from museum kiosk to digital cultural atlas. Example applications include the Sydney TimeMap museum kiosk, MacquarieNet on-line encyclopaedia, Fairfield multicultural tourism Web site, UNESCO World Heritage Sites database, and a map animation of the Khmer Empire. The paper also addresses some of the issues in handling complex datasets effectively on low bandwidth connections, and shows how TimeMap has addressed these through on-demand data loading, server-side filtering, dynamic map legends and dynamically constructed hotlinks."

From 1997 to 2003, museum educators at the University of Illinois' Spurlock Museum have explored how students unable to travel to the museum could make the most effective use of the museum's online resources. Using problem-based learning methodologies, museum educators worked with several local school teachers to develop a series of projects that were closely integrated with the students' classroom activities. This paper evaluates the results of the program and presents the process of developing one of these projects: an analysis of the authenticity of ancient Egyptian cartonnage fragments."

However, rapid technological advancements (increased processor speed, advanced digital video processing) and mass production have both lowered the cost and dramatically increased the efficacy of eye- and gaze-tracking equipment. This opens up a whole new area of interaction mechanisms with museum content. In this paper I will describe a conceptual framework for an interface, designed for use in museums and galleries, which is based on non-invasive tracking of a viewer's gaze direction. Following the simple premise that prolonged visual fixation is an indication of a viewer's interest, I dubbed this approach intention-based interface."

The authors have already been involved in eight substantial online collections projects, with many more in prospect. Each case has presented different challenges. This paper will review the state of the art based on our work and notable developments elsewhere. We will provide a practical overview of common project requirements including user interface, content management system and likely future developments of both. Online collections projects typically leverage prior investments in collections management information, documentation, photography and digital imaging. They also naturally deliver new content into an existing corporate web site. So it is vital that the new system integrate with the web site at the front-end and with the collections management system, image assets and other data sources at the back-end. We will provide ideas on how the key architectural and technical issues can be successfully resolved in order to deliver a first rate user experience for the public and a manageable environment for the museum's web team. We will also discuss how the way that a project is approached can benefit future developments for non-standard and future platforms including mobile and wireless devices."

    "abstract": "A day in Cape York, in the far north east of Australia, can change the life of a modern Australian. In that time, one can see hundreds of examples of rock art that are up to 36,000 years old, sharply contrasting the history of Indigenous people and the immigration of Europeans. One such visit led to a proposed collaboration between the Quinkan Culture Elders and a team of metadata researchers. The researchers proposed a Qualified Dublin Core style catalogue to be used to identify and record examples of Quinkan Culture so Elders could at last gain access to information needed to manage the proliferation of unauthorised publications about Quinkan culture, and to 'bring back home' cultural representations. In addition, the catalogue would allow the Elders to make decisions about publishing their own representations. This paper describes the journey of members of the team developing 'Matchbox', a cataloguing system, as they have sought a way of using Qualified DC metadata (QDC) to describe, collect, and represent Quinkan Culture. Of interest in this paper is how developing a QDC representation has led to questions of cultural definition and, simultaneously, of the use of technologies such as HTML, XML and RDF."

    "abstract": "The Natural History Museum at the University of Bergen has a unique collection of 24 whale skeletons on display that is believed to be the largest of its kind in the world. The museum wishes to make this collection, which literally fills 2 rooms, accessible to the international community through a Web exhibit. Our principle challenges include a limited budget, selection of appropriate filming techniques, and content presentation to a varied public that includes both researchers and school children. Our goal is to provide an exhibit that can support both the in-depth and broad overview interests of our anticipated users. The whale skeletons in our collection are large objects -- up to 24m (80ft). We are therefore exploring alternatives for inclusion of video presentations in the exhibit design. One option is to use an overview video and develop a two-level interface in which images, video, and audio clips of the whales with maps and stories are linked at the surface level where we expect the general public will browse, while research data that supports study of skeletal material is linked at a deeper, zoom level. An alternative is to use an architectural sketch of the physical exhibit as the interface and focus on development of item videos for presentation of the individual skeletons of each species. In this paper, we present an evaluation of alternative uses of video and zoom technology for exhibits of large-scale objects. We demonstrate that adequate video quality can be within the economic reach of low-budget museums."

The Institute, an encyclopedic art museum, produces and maintains two Web sites (http://www.artsmia.org and http://www.artsconnected.org -- the latter in conjunction with Walker Art Center). It also provides its physical visitors with a host of interactive media programs in the museum itself -- from a museum directory to a large number of permanent collection-based programs located throughout the building. The research has been designed to a) measure audience awareness of and satisfaction with these resources; b) respond to those findings with improvements; then c) re-measure to gauge the effect of the improvements. A further goal of this project is to share its logic model, methodology, instruments, and findings with the museum community. To date, the benchmarking data has been compiled and analyzed. Production and marketing work are now in progress. This paper is a mid-project report on what we've learned so far, and where we're going. It includes detailed descriptions of the instruments used for data collection (from Usability Lab to Web and in-gallery surveys), presentation of the initial findings, and a discussion of how those findings informed the actions now being taken.

Three-dimensional data is complex, and application of modeling and analytic techniques significantly enhances the capacity for researchers to extract meaning from 3D information. The tool prototypes simplify analysis of surface and volume using curvature and topology to help researchers understand and interact with 3D data. The tools automatically extract information about features and regions of interest to researchers, calculate quantifiable, replicable metric data, and generate metadata about the object being studied. To make this information useful to researchers, the project developed prototype interactive, sketch-based interfaces that permit researchers to remotely search, identify and interact with the detailed, highly accurate 3D models of the objects. The results support comparative analysis of contextual and spatial information, and extend research about asymmetric man-made and natural objects that can significantly extend the interactive capabilities of museums for exhibitions, education, and outreach."

    "abstract": "With regard to the acceptance of human-computer interfaces, immersion represents one of the most important methods for attracting young visitors into museum exhibitions. Exciting and diversely presented content as well as intuitive, natural and human-like interfaces are indispensable to bind users to an interactive system with real and digital parts. In order to overcome the obstacles to attracting the young, we have taken an interdisciplinary approach to the fields of multimedia, media design, TV/movie or literature, and especially myths, to develop narrative edutainment applications for kids. Similar to Hollywood, production content and dramaturgic scripts are generated by authoring tools and transmitted by multimodal interfaces enhanced by natural conversation forms. These concepts are enhanced by interaction design principles, methods and appliances; such as Kids Innovation or momunaMomuna. This paper describes both existing technologies and new innovative methods and concepts of interactive digital storytelling and user interaction design to establish immersive edutainment applications and appliances using multimodal user interfaces. These approaches merging into Dino-Hunter as innovative game-oriented mobile edutainment appliances are discussed within the environment of mobile application scenarios for museums and their young visitors."

    "abstract": "The Art Museum Image Consortium \"AMICO\" is a group of over three-dozen Member Museums, which have committed to digitize their collections and contribute them to an integrated library on an on-going basis. The AMICO Library has been available to educational institutions-- including colleges and universities, elementary and secondary schools, public libraries and museums-- for almost five years and grows significantly each year. The 2003 edition of The AMICO Library will contain over 120,000 works of art. After three years of distribution through a single source (RLG, Inc.), AMICO began contracting with other Distributors, each specializing in a different audience, to reach and meet the diverse needs of multiple user communities. Today, each of these six Distributors delivers The AMICO Library through their own unique interfaces, often along with other digital resources. This range of Distributors now allows subscribing institutions to choose among the different services and interfaces that are compatible with their institutional requirements and best meet the needs of their end users. The variety of Distributors of The AMICO Library also allows AMICO Member Museums to access and view their digital documentation through a variety of tools and interfaces developed outside of their own direct influence or control. Each Distributor and interface has a significant effect on how the work is used, explored and perceived. This paper explores the multiple interface approach to distributing content as well as the differences in features and functions of multiple distributors. Issues addressed include audience specific functionality, inter-application consistency and the need for additional research."

    "abstract": "Continuous, formative evaluation, from inception to completion, with rapid revisions, was key to the successful development of Kids Design Network (KDN) by the DuPage Children's Museum (DCM). Although a thorough evaluation plan was developed at the beginning of the project, it soon became apparent that additional strategies were necessary to insure success. As new issues were identified and planned techniques were found inadequate, new evaluation techniques were developed and implemented. The development of KDN illustrates the importance of flexible, formative evaluation from the inception of a program to its completion. KDN is an interactive Internet-based learning program for elementary aged students. Using the KDN Web site (http://www.dupagechildrensmuseum.org/kdn) , students work collaboratively with an engineer (via real-time communication on the KDN Engineer Chatboard), their classmates and teacher to design, build and test a gadget that meets an engineering challenge. Interactive portions of the Web site include a drawing program where students draw a design for their gadget and a whiteboard with chat where children and engineers can mark on the student's design and communicate via text chat. DCM brought in an evaluation consultant in the very early stages of KDN development. The evaluator became an integral part of development and continuously collaborated with the team. The collaborative nature of the evaluation and the fluidity of the plan ultimately produced a workable, user friendly Web site consistent with the museum's mission."

    "abstract": "Since the World Wide Web became in 1994 the first new mass medium since television, online learning design has evolved at Internet speed, taking in less than a decade what it took exhibit design over a century to develop in sophistication. Although virtual exhibits consisting of pictures and text are still common, educational Web designers increasingly employ techniques borrowed from interactive exhibit developers, video game producers, and museum educators to create compelling activities that fully exploit the strengths of the new medium. Constructivist learning theory often informs these new approaches. However, transplanting learning theory from the classroom or museum environment to the Web poses unique challenges. In this paper, we review several theories of learning and explore ways that we have tried to incorporate them into our development and design process for interactive Web sites. Constructivism underlies much educational practice in museums and is the basis for all of the learning theories we survey in this paper. Each of these, however, clarifies, expands upon, or revises the notion of constructivism in ways that can help Web designers better conceptualize and execute their projects. For example, Kolb's model of learning styles highlights the structure of the learning process. This model offers insight into how to make Web media go beyond the convergent/logical learning that comes easiest to computer-based learning, and to teach divergent, practical, and social learners. Similarly, Gardner's checklist of multiple entry points offers a valuable perspective on diversity in learning, prompting us to look for ways to engage various intelligences in one package. Most dramatically, Egan's notion of developmental \"kinds of understanding\" frees us from the strict constructivist demand to account for the concrete prior knowledge of our mostly anonymous online audiences. Instead of attempting that impossible feat, or ignoring the issue entirely, we can engage children's and adults' imaginative capacities with stories about profound abstractions, the limits of reality and experience, and our place in the world."

However, they are also coming to understand the opportunities for knowledge misuse and misappropriation of their knowledge which may accompany digitization. In this paper we describe a set of open source software tools designed to enable indigenous communities to protect unique cultural knowledge and materials preserved through digitization. The software tools described here enable authorized members of communities to define and control the rights, accessibility and reuse of their digital resources; uphold traditional laws pertaining to secret/sacred knowledge or objects; prevent the misuse of indigenous heritage in culturally inappropriate or insensitive ways; ensure proper attribution to the traditional owners; and enable indigenous communities to describe their resources in their own words. Hopefully the deployment of such tools will contribute to the self-determination and empowerment of indigenous communities through the revitalization of their cultures and knowledge which colonization, western laws, western cultures and globalization have eroded."

    "abstract": "Museums are fundamental for communities to protect their identity and for their cultural preservation. By expanding outreach efforts and providing the community with access to knowledge and information, museums contribute greatly to strengthening the communities' capability to confront the challenges that 21st century globalization presents. A traveling exhibition organized by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) titled, Corridos sin Fronteras, includes an educational web site that is designed to archive and explain one of Mexico's musical and historical traditions, \"the corrido\" a Mexican folk ballad. The Corridos web site (www.corridos.org) was designed and developed by Interactive Knowledge (IK). The site is completely bilingual and designed to make the content from the Corridos sin Fronteras exhibition widely accessible. One critical goal at the outset of the web site design project was to make sure that the content was regarded as the Mexican cultural treasure that it is. In order to do that, SITES insisted that the English and Spanish languages be treated as equal in importance to visitors to the site. One result is that the language can be switched on any screen. There is an option at the top of each screen that allows users to switch languages at will. In this fast changing world, technology and the use of multimedia experiences in museums are effective and accessible solutions that help museums achieve their goals of community outreach and meeting the community's demands. This paper will address philosophical principles and practical applications on the use of multimedia experiences in museums. By using the exhibition Corridos sin Fronteras: A New World Ballad Tradition as a model, panelists will analyze technological and outreach strategies and the public's response to new multimedia learning experiences, and how it can enrich the museum experience for a diverse community."

This architecture is discussed in the context of Village Voice, an interactive video browser developed as part of my M.S. research at the MIT Media Laboratory. Village Voice has shown potential as a system that can archive content generated by community members through its departure from traditional methods of using the Web to represent museum exhibits. Instead of basing content and their interrelations around ad-hoc indices, Village Voice allows the user to interact with material based on how the community itself articulates the relationships within its different pieces. I refer to this information architecture as ontology. Village Voice's interface is based around a dynamic collage which is able to reveal the complexity of the artifacts of a community because it can adapt to a user's browsing history and the intricate relationships within the different materials in the exhibit. I will discuss the means by which the system, interface, and ontology were developed, and its deployment in a Somali refugee community within the Boston metropolitan area, as well as efforts being undertaken in a North Indian village in the Faridabad, Haryana district. After presenting the architecture and project, I discuss the potential of this technology to archive and faithfully represent the experiences of communities through a simple evaluation."

During the presentation, a sequence of pictures is synchronized with the audio commentary, and the transitions among the pictures are planned according to cinematic techniques. The theoretical background is presented, discussing the language of cinematography and the Rhetorical Structure Theory to analyze dependency relationships inside a text. In building the video clips, a set of strategies similar to those used in documentaries was employed. Two broad classes of strategies have been identified. The first class encompasses constraints imposed by the grammar of cinematography, while the second deals with conventions normally used in guiding camera movements in the production of documentaries. The results of a preliminary evaluation are also presented and discussed."

The Education Division of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, partnering with our technology experts and other divisions in the Museum, have created an integrated database system (HEDDA) that marries legacy databases with new front-end design, held together by middleware. This system has been designed with the web in mind, and is being used in many creative ways. This paper will explore various web projects and the database creation process from a project manager's point of view. I will be using examples from our system, such as: 1) a database that was in a flat file format, then was converted to our integrated system and posted on our web site; 2) a database that allows the people whose information is stored in the database itself to edit and update their own records through the web; 3) a database containing data on Holocaust education in the United States that will be posted on our web site in a graphic, interactive format; and, 4) a database that tracks who gets the Museum's educational publications. Visitors to our web site can order materials through a simple web form, and our staff can send that record with one click into the database. With these examples, I will be able to show how the back-end databases and web sites work together to solve problems for managers and eliminate duplicate efforts across our institution."

The launch of the web portal in May/June 2003 will be the fruition of a four-year collaboration between the five museums. The rationale behind the portal is that, for historic reasons that are unknown to most real and virtual museum visitors, Manchester has five major separately constituted museums, whose collections relate and overlap in a number of ways. By offering a single access-point to information about the combined collections of the partner museums, the web portal will improve public understanding of the collections of all five museums and will enable the museums to work together more effectively through greater knowledge of each other's collections."

    "abstract": "Children & teenagers, 18-35 year olds, minorities, the disabled -- every group on this list is considered an important audience by art museums. What are we doing to serve them? What benefits have accrued after years of educational and cognitive theory and with the advent of new tools and technologies? Art museums have reached all new highs (and lows) in their approaches to underserved communities. This paper looks beyond our best intentions to actual outcomes. What does the content we choose to display on the web reveal about our commitment to certain audiences? How do special audiences discern the differences between commitment and special-project pandering? Have we failed audiences by judging our best efforts according to low standards? Few art museums have the money, staff, skill-sets to serve all these special targeted audiences effectively. What best practices guidelines exist outside of the museum field for serving children, minorities, and the disabled on the web? Improved content, decreased legal liability, greater audience reachthese are just a few of the benefits that result when our web sites are made more accessible. This paper charts where art museums have been and where they are going in terms of four targeted audiences: children, minorities, and the disabled."

The exhibition used computer network intensively, particularly the image generated by mirror effect, to record and retrive the photo taken an Intranet in the museum. Visitors could also view their images at home through their Internet connections and browsers. This system came true by the integration of IP camera, IP bar code reader, Internet browser, back-end SQL server and Flash programming. This paper will discuss from system planning, implementation, problem solving to the statistic data collected."

    "abstract": "The Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design and Typography at the Cooper Union School of Art offers Lubalin Curatorial Fellowship on the irregular basis to its recipient to conduct art and design related research and curate public exhibition based from the research. In 2000 The Center granted the Fellowship for the topic entitled \"Chinese Graphic Design towards the International Sphere,\" the first time such topic were ever given by the Center. The research was carried out by interviewing and collecting works from over 50 prominent Chinese graphic designers and studios from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. The exhibition at the Gallery of Herb Lubalin Study Center was open from September 4 to December 1, 2001 which attracted hundreds of visitors. It provides a non-mainstream visual cultural experiences to American audience. One of the visitor' comments the exhibition gave her peace of mind after what happened on September 11. This exhibition is also a visual reference for a poster design project for students at the Cooper under the direction of Philippe Apeloig, the graphic design professor and the Director of the Herb Lubalin Study Center. This exhibition enriched the visual experience of American audience and students at the Cooper with graphic design in the Greater China region from a historical perspective. However, this visual enhancement experience was limited by the physical space and time span as most exhibitions held at the museums and galleries face. After the end of this exhibition, the Center decided to explore the possibility of applying on-line medium in transferring this on-site display event to virtual space. Upon receiving the brief from the Center, the curator of this exhibition re-thinks the possible critical issue of \"transforming\" a physical exhibition into a hyper-reality environment. Key question such as how to maintain and reconstruct a similar exhibition visit experience as in the 3-dimensional space from the audience's perspective became the major challenge for designing this on-line exhibition version. After studying and considering various displaying possibility available in the web format, the curator decided to adopt a visual based mouse-over technique rather than a data based html coded individual web page. This presentation studies how the Center applied the Web as a medium to extend the exhibition restricted by physical accessibility and time. First, background and the content of the exhibition will be given. Second, it reviews the design of the exhibition and the system of displaying exhibits. Third, it examines how different web page design techniques can fulfill the objectives of maintaining and reconstructing a similar exhibition visit experience to the audience as they would have at the exhibition in person. Finally, the solution of this on-line exhibition will be reviewed and deconstructed as to how the design \"transforming\" the exhibition and the experience of the audience on an exhibition visit. Comparison will be made upon on the original display system design of the exhibition and the final interface and interactive design for the on-line exhibition. This on-line exhibition is now available in the virtual space although the exhibition was finished in December 2001."

    "abstract": "In real museums, visitors may find the help of a human tour guide in order to guide them through the exhibition and present information tailored to their interests. Accordingly, online museums could also benefit from digital 'life-like' characters in order to guide users to virtual tours and to customize the tour information in accordance to users' interests. Digital characters have been explored in online museum websites with different degrees of interaction and modes of communication (Bertoletti et al., 2001; Adams et al., 2001; Isbister et al., 1999). Such researches, however, do not explore interactive \"conversational\" characters. Our main interest is in a tour-guide character that provides tour information through dialogue with the user. Our research developed an interactive conversational character that establishes a 'character-user' dialogue while guiding the user through the virtual tour. The tour-guide character provides tour information and responses to users' textual inputs by speaking through audio output and gesturing accordingly. Moreover, the tour-guide character attempts to provide adaptive guidance, to perform engaging storytelling and to promote user's participation through the virtual tour. In this paper, we describe the experiment focusing on the creation of the paths for the dialogue flow and on the character's knowledge database. We further describe the system's implementation and evaluation; and, finally, discuss some evaluation conclusions."

In the LISTEN project conducted by the Fraunhofer Institut in St. Augustin, we augment every day environments with audio information. In order to distribute and administer this information in an efficient way, we decided to employ an information brokering tool for the management of information items. Furthermore, the generation of user profiles and the personalized presentation of information are possible by this means. This contribution depicts an approach of transferring our information brokering experience to Web museum applications. We show how the LISTEN domain model can easily be extended by an overlay model and adapted to a Web museum environment."

However, does this new formula facilitate getting information on the arts, and do digitized works of art help redeem the aesthetic experiment. I will investigate how cultural institutions make use of the Internet as a specific mode of access to the arts, and therefore examine from a French perspective what resources should be used when browsing on-line exhibitions, as museum web designers possess little knowledge of users' tastes. Referring to a qualitative research undertaken by the Direction des musées de France on ten web museums, I will demonstrate that the use of the Internet for museums is perceived as ?knowledgeable information? for users. It is stressed that a virtual museum can cause users who cannot evaluate the site from content on the homepage to lose interest. Nevertheless, I assert that emerging electronic language forms undoubtedly influence the course of ?individual learning?, but also offer a particular outlook of masterpieces, as visitors must get acquainted with the ergonomics through a myriad of informational and technical patterns (e.g., hypertext links, icons, VMRL). From an elaborate grid, I will show what sort of homepages, computer graphics, navigational paths, types of content and application software are preferred."

    "abstract": "Mystic Seaport was faced with redesigning an old website that had grown to an unruly 10,000 files representing more or less 2,000 separate web pages many of which were accessible only by luck or through the use of a site search engine. In addition, there was considerable pressure to make collections resources available online, to develop the online store and e-business opportunities, to serve potential visitors and tourist markets, to develop new online educational opportunities, and solve a long list of institutional ills, respond to a number of strategic plans, and capitalize on many perceived opportunities. The problem was not uncommon. The solution was to approach the entire website from the point of view of the basic information architecture of the museum, the perceived users of museum information (based on a variety of audience surveys), and a set of realizable information management goals. Institutionally, the website becomes a manifestation of a lively information architecture encompassing collections, programs, products, customer management, the calendar, and publications. In some cases, existing information management solutions were applied more or less directly to the web. In others, new solutions utilizing the web were developed."

However, for other museums, this can be a daunting prospect, both technically and financially. It is also likely to be much less effective. A solution could be to create an on-line museum community of small to medium sized museums who alone would struggle to make such an enterprise a success but who together, with suitable help, could rival the efforts of national museums. This mini-workshop examines existing example of museum e-commerce and facilities that could be used by museums. It then goes on to propose a possible infrastructure for museums wishing to take their initial steps in e-commerce at low cost and low risk."

    "abstract": "The Victoria & Albert Museum in London is the world's largest museum of the decorative arts and is home to 145 galleries, including national collections of sculpture, furniture, fashion and photographs. In November 2001, the V&A opened the British Galleries, its largest gallery project in over 50 years. Covering 15 rooms the galleries offer a chronological survey of the history of design in Britain from 1500 to 1900 covering British design and art from the reign of Henry VIII to that of Queen Victoria. Virtually every major name in the history of British design is included, including designers such as William Morris and Charles Rennie Mackintosh, manufacturers such as Wedgwood and Liberty's, and national treasures such as Henry VIII's writing desk, Queen Elizabeth I's virginals, and James II's wedding suit. From the beginning of the 7 year project, the galleries were designed around the inclusion of multiple forms of interpretation aimed at the full range of visitors that the Museum plays host to. Amongst some 200 interactives are 18 individual web-based applications served to 40 kiosks, 20 short films, 3 cinema films, 21 spoken audio points and 8 music points. So how does a Museum previously criticised for being \"dull\" and \"dusty\" turn around visitor perception and handle the complicated interaction of screen with art, both in a physical space and on-screen? How do you weave a cross- museum team exceeding 100 people, and multiple outside contractors to deliver a usable, coherent, and maintainable system? And how do you do it with a museum budget? This session will look at the people, processes and the pitfalls that came together to deliver the largest art gallery interactive development in the UK in recent years: a development that has seen visitor figures rise by 300%, unprecedented compliments from visitors, a BAFTA nomination for best use of new media, and the basis for the future of interactive developments at the V&A. In depth, we will follow the 18-month prototyping and testing phase that led to the development of the detailed functional specifications that allowed the system to be developed and delivered in the final 9 months of the project. In particular, we will focus on the challenges of kiosk usability and the role of user-trials in raising usability to the level of all our audiences, and the critical question of maintaining such a large-scale, high profile development.

    "abstract": "On January 15, 2001, the National Museum of Asian Arts - Guimet in Paris reopened after an extensive renovation project. The museum's first real web site accompanied this reopening and went online, not coincidentally, on the same day. The renovated museum was dramatically different from the one that had closed its doors nearly five years before, and the web site was designed to be a reflection of the \"new\" Musée Guimet. This paper will examine the experience of designing and building the web site, in particular, the cultural and political issues involved in representing a European museum which contains one of the world's largest collections of Asian art. Designing an appropriate site meant paying attention to design and content issues, and their possible impact on Asian visitors. As the vision and goals of the museum's director were brought to life, a number of factors played a role, such as the potential audiences of the site, geo-political concerns, and France's relationship to and presence in Southeast and East Asia."

    "abstract": "At the University of Guadalajara a science education Web site has been developed. For the last two years professors have contributed as science consultants. At the moment we are developing a project that would be better described as a natural science museum on the Web for the state of Jalisco, Mexico for extension purposes. For this project the community of agricultural and biological science professors represents our best source of people to contribute to this site. The use of the Internet by professors is a two-fold question where, in one hand, we want to know the intensity of use of the web, and in the other hand we want to know how much, as an academic community this group would likely participate with contributions for the world via this medium. There is one tool that is helping us determine the likelihood that this academic community would contribute and the purpose of this paper is to share this tool with other professionals, and to share the information we found. In this paper the use of a self-efficacy instrument based on Bandura's social learning theory (1986) is discussed. This concept was developed to explain the effect of self-efficacy, the judgement that each of us have about our own skills in our own decisions to perform an activity, and the performance in the practice. Considering that the success in the performance of an activity requires effort and perseverance, performance operates partially independent of our skill. Self-efficacy is more related to our judgments about a possible performance than to our skills. A number of instruments have been developed to measure self-efficacy concepts, but so far none that measure the particular condition that exists in Latin-American countries. The instrument has 17 items that measure judgments about computers and Internet use. The instrument was used twice with the same community (234 professors), 1998 and 2001. On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is \"not confident\" and 5 is \"most confident\" professors were asked to react to the statement: \"My confidence level for performing this task is:\" When we compare the results of the 1998 with the 2001 questionnaire, it was found that the general mean for this scale (1-5) in 2001 is 3.0, when for 1998 the general mean was 2.6. The items with the highest mean in 2001 were the same for the 1998 results, these are: \"send e-mail\" (3.8) and , and \"find specific information on the Internet\" (3.7). Similarly, the two items with the lowest mean for 2001 were the same for the 1998 results: \"create a home-page\" (1.9) and \"use a list-server and chat rooms\" (2.1). These indicators provide information that this community is more likely to be consumers of the information rather than producers. It also provides us with direction to invest our efforts in training and campaigning programs if we want to increase our academic presence in the Internet."

    "abstract": "Developing effective public education sites for the World Wide Web requires an understanding of both learning theories and what appeals to leisure learners. Research indicates that active learning modes are most effective (Hein 1998). But at Museums & the Web 2001, IBM researchers presented findings that leisure learners prefer passive entertainment experiences over more demanding interactive experiences (Karat, et al. 2001). Educational web developers are left with the disturbing proposition that they can create effective learning materials, but that leisure learners will not consume them. This paper reports on a web site evaluation project that seeks to clarify the different factors involved in successfully engaging leisure learners. This study focuses on six educational Web activities, all developed by Educational Web Adventures (Eduweb) in collaboration with its clients. They represent a wide range of approaches to structuring Web-based educational activities and cover a broad spectrum of subject content, including art history, American history, and natural science. They include an encyclopedic/reference site, a simulation modeling a process, role-playing games, and creative play activities. All of the sites are aimed at a middle school or above audience. The study uses quantitative and qualitative data from server log analysis and exit surveys of Web visitors. Duration of visit from the log analysis is a rough measure of holding power. The exit survey solicits quantitative feedback - demographics, personal preferences in Web activities, and evaluation of the Web activity in question - as well as qualitative feedback about the user's experience. We expect to correlate these responses and user evaluations of each project and draw some tentative conclusions about the appeal and effectiveness of various formats to different audiences for active learning on the Web."

Elly Rubin, of the MFA's Education Division, has been focusing on Web access issues, and has even written a few recent articles on the subject, published in NEMA . She will introduce us to many issues of Web accessibility, from assistive technologies to multimedia content. Elly will be joined by special guests, who develop or use assistive technologies for the Internet. They will demonstrate how many folks with disabilities surf the Web. We will see and use a text reader software to surf the Web, and experience them from the perspective of someone who may be blind or visually impaired. She will also present a \"top-ten\" list of strategies to ensure a more accessible site, using specific examples from a recent Web Accessibility Report, commissioned by the MFA. This report, focused on specific parts of www.mfa.org , made specific recommendations about how to improve accessibility of the site. We will even review and compare some cutting-edge multimedia Web technologies, like Flash, Windows Media, and Real. We will also review the findings of some of Elly's recent research, including a focus group, done in conjunction with Peter Ty, at the Carroll Center for the Blind, and some interesting results from an accessibility questionnaire, administered to members of the MFA's Accessibility Advisory Board. In addition, we've compiled a large body of research around the state of accessibility of many of our peer institution's Web sites. We will take at some examples of more or less accessible sites."

    "abstract": "Science Museums and Science Centers are increasingly seeking more engaging, active ways of involving their audiences. The two partner institutions in this project are working with teachers to get students actively involved with real-world science and technology as preparation for employment and citizenship, whilst building ongoing relationships between the science museums, teachers and community organisations. Last year, US and UK Online Museum Educators (OMEs) worked with The Franklin Institute and the Science Museum, London to create 'Pieces of Science', a series of online learning resources, each inspired by a particular museum object. 'Pieces' has been very well received, and inspired the team to consider another ambitious project, aimed at involving students, as well as their teachers. In this second year of collaboration the focus has shifted to creating community and issues-based science projects, designed to engage older (high school) students and their teachers in community service, issues-based discussion and interaction with practising scientists. The legacy of each project will be a website providing related classroom resources alongside a record of the activities and a toolkit to support other secondary teachers to develop similar activities. Staff from the two museums are supporting the teachers in the development of activities and models. As the teachers create their educational resources, they document their process so that, by the end, there will be a body of data from which staff can draw conclusions and report findings. Likewise, while the teachers are creating resources, they will engage in conversation with their international colleagues, ultimately broadening the scope of their thinking and providing an international context for their educational resource creation. Based on the lessons from Year 1, this process includes creating thematic groupings, mixing UK and US OMEs and videoconferencing. This paper will focus on presenting lessons learnt and suggestions for anyone considering similar projects in the near future, including issues such as how to engender constructive online interaction and what works and what does not in online collaboration projects."

An increasing proportion of the Museum's curatorial objects are included in the Collections Information System (CIS), and the V&A's National Art Library http://www.nal.vam.ac.uk is close to completing a major project to transfer all its older records to an online catalogue. An Online Museum project has been established, and the V&A's web site http://www.vam.ac.uk has been relaunched. In addition to populating these core information and documentation systems, V&A staff have embarked upon various initiatives designed to capture crucial information relating to the Museum's own historic activities. Examples include the compilation of a comprehensive bibliography and chronology of the V&A's publishing and exhibition history, and the computerisation of the Museum's institutional records. In collaboration with staff and students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts, an online version of the full text of important documents relating to the Museum's earliest acquisitions is also being created, in XML format. The paper attempts to demonstrate how the various projects relate to other information systems and standards in the V&A and indeed elsewhere, with reference to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), Computer Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI),Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Spectrum and MARC21, among others."

    "abstract": "This presentation will discuss the steps necessary to set up an effective e-mail marketing plan for museums, with the emphasis on newsletters. To maintain a positive impression, you must understand the line between ethical and non-ethical use of e-mail. Most museums use direct mail to send unsolicited information to prospective members' homes. While this is tolerated in the physical world, it is not accepted in the virtual world. It could leave your museum open to criticism, problems with your Internet service provider, and even legal troubles. The line between permission based mailing and 'spam' must be understood before an e-mail marketing plan is begun. The tone and style of an e-mail campaign should match the other publications of the museum; perhaps the same team that prepares the information for a printed newsletter will prepare the electronic newsletter. Once the message has been produced, it has to be distributed to the recipients. Production and distribution could be achieved with Microsoft Outlook and Qualcomm's Eudora, but these programs do not offer the flexibility, tracking, and efficiency of programs designed for mass mailings. Stone Analytic's Key Factor and mailing list options will be discussed as well. Are you ready to use the most efficient, affordable tool in your marketing chest? E-mail will help you build the visitor foundation every museum needs for future growth and solidity."

    "abstract": "This presentation examines some of the challenges involved in translating live performance into a digital presentation. Using \"The Potable Joyce\" performance piece developed for the Rosenbach Museum and Library as the source, the Rosenbach and Night Kitchen Media assembled a team of writers, musicians and designers to bring the project to the screen. The live performance combines actors, music, shadow puppets and props to tell the story of The Odyssey, the first Ulysses, and the processes by which Joyce used the tale as the basis for writing his modern manuscript. Conceived by Sebastienne Mundheim, a writer and educator, the multi-layered live performance posed many challenges to create a rich, effective digital adaptation. Beginning with a review of the original materials, from a video of the live performance to a brief discussion of the challenges posed by the source text of Joyce and Homer, we will examine the creative and practical approaches to digitizing source content and developing appropriate design aesthetics for the different levels of the live performance. We'll move from there to a demonstration of the stages of production involved in this project, from the audio recording and image processing to the graphical treatment and animation of the content. We'll discuss the tools used, the team and their roles, as well as the overall timeline for such a project. To finish off we will showcase a portion of the project and discuss its uses, including Web delivery, CD-ROM creation and the kiosk installation for the upcoming James Joyce special exhibition."

    "abstract": "The Internet is a communication channel where ideas and information may be freely and easily shared and communicated among members of diverse communities around the world. By combining the capabilities of latest computers, communication and multimedia technologies, web-base multimedia systems can be developed and delivered through Internet to the distributed users around the globe. Web-based multimedia systems provide an exciting means and communication channel for information access and sharing throughout the world. These systems have immense potential in public education, stimulating the learning process by exploring and doing, and by bringing children out of their school compound on trips around the world with just a few clicks. In this study, a web-based multimedia exhibition ?Colours of the Wind? was designed and developed based on an existing exhibition that took the original form of static physical displays. The exhibition is part of a series of National Education exhibitions put together by the National Archives of Singapore to promote heritage information awareness among school children. As part of the design, a requirements gathering study was carried out with 77 university students to determine the users? requirements in terms of their computer and web experience, content expectations of online exhibition and their prior exposure to these systems. Based on these user requirements, a prototype of an online exhibition system was developed which was subsequently evaluated to assess the prototype and to elicit gaps in the design. In the evaluation with 30 students from the same pool form whom requirements were gathered, it was found that the online exhibition was well received by the surveyed community. The respondents were of the opinion that it has satisfied most of their requirements of an online exhibition apart from a search engine. They also felt that online exhibitions were the most flexible mode of delivering heritage information to inculcate awareness among the school children and public, particularly so, in the context of Singapore. It is because that Singapore is one of the countries of highest percentage of Internet users in the world."

We look at collaborative environments that span different media, in particular handheld mobile devices, Web-based hypermedia and 3D virtual environments. We discuss two main strands in our research: the methods and results of two pilot visitor studies in two cultural institutions in Glasgow?the Lighthouse and the House for an Art Lover?and the development of our prototype system which establishes three-sided collaboration between physical, Web and virtual environment visitors. We then present preliminary results and issues arising from our on-going system development and user trials. We conclude with future plans for further system evaluation and deployment."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of an evaluation of 'History Wired' at the National Museum of American History, March and April, 200l prior to its launch in August, 2001. The evaluation included in-site usability studies with groups of visitors to the museum, interviews with designers and comments by a Museum Studies class. The visitor research was based on the concepts and methods of audience ethnography, so it documented the spontaneous interests of users rather than setting predetermined tasks. This way, we could discover how the website shaped a variety of responses, and how users created their own experience from the many possibilities of navigation and content. The paper describes the different ways that visitors used the website and their own comments on its unusual design. The study predicted the site's success with broad audience groups and suggested some wording changes to make the ?tiled? interface more descriptive of the actual contents. The research was conducted as part of an Australian Fulbright Professional Award."

    "url": "https://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2002/papers/woodruff/woodruff.html",
    "year": "2002",
    "abstract": "We describe an electronic guidebook, Sotto Voce, that enables visitors to share audio information by eavesdropping on each other's guidebook activity. We have conducted three studies of visitors using electronic guidebooks in a historic house: one study with open air audio played through speakers and two studies with eavesdropped audio. An analysis of visitor interaction in these studies suggests that eavesdropped audio provides more social and interactive learning resources than open air audio played through speakers. Sotto Voce runs on handheld computers that include a color LCD touchscreen display. Individual visitors obtain information about objects in their environment using a visual interface that resembles a set of Web browser imagemaps. The visitor sees a single photographic imagemap that depicts one wall of a room in a museum or historic house; visitors can choose which imagemap to display at a given time. When visitors tap on an imagemap target, the guidebook plays an audio clip that describes that object. In previous experiments with the guidebook, visitors liked sharing descriptions by playing audio through speakers of the device. However, this solution is noisy and generally unsuitable for public settings. Therefore, we have developed a new prototype that uses wireless local-area networking to allow paired visitors to share audio content. Each visitor is able to eavesdrop on their companion's guidebook, using a special volume control. With this design, each person can operate their own guidebook and choose the descriptions they want to listen to, while preserving the ability to listen to descriptions synchronously with their companion. To facilitate conversation, Sotto Voce uses single-ear headsets that leave one ear available to hear sounds from the external environment. Since we use single-ear headsets, both personal and eavesdropped audio content are necessarily presented in the same ear. We distinguish the two types of content using reverberation and volume differentiation. Sotto Voce has been tested in several rooms at Filoli, a historic house in Woodside, California. Our most recent study included 47 members of the general public, who were observed in situ, interviewed, and monitored by video and audio recording and logging of guidebook activity. Our evaluation includes affinity clustering of interview data and the use of conversation analytic techniques. The results indicate that visitors are able to use the system effectively, both as a conversational resource and as an information source. Visitors who listen to audio together typically assign Sotto Voce a role in their conversations, verbally responding to it and treating it like a human storyteller. This promotes visitor interaction while preserving each visitor's ability to select individual objects. Further, our results suggest that the technologically mediated audio often coheres the visitors' conversation and activity to a far greater degree than audio delivered through open air via speakers."

    "abstract": "What do we really know about museums and the Internet? What can we really say and back up with evidence about the virtual museum and the virtual visitors? As with any fast-growing field, any time this discussion arises we have endlessly more questions than answers. Our battle is made even more difficult by our goals. Virtual museums may measure eyeballs and click-through rate, but the mission is not achieved when the visitor buys something. The virtual museum's mission is to inform, to enlighten, and perhaps to change lives. And museums have risen to this challenge. During this decade, museums have put enormous amount of energy, both in hours and dollars into a virtual presence. In order evaluate what the virtual museums sites achieve and to continue to push the boundaries of what they can achieve, we need to stand back and review the questions we've been asking about virtual museums and the answers we think we know. In this paper the authors will discuss the facts about the museum online experience: What are the basics of the on-line museum experience: the who, what, with whom, and how sorts of questions? Whom do we know we reach? What do they tend to do? How does this compare with the other virtual experiences people are having? The authors will achieve this through an in-depth review of the literature, drawing on sources both in the virtual museum field and in related fields. We will also take a look at the relationship between the physical and the virtual sites. To examine the dynamics of this relationship, the authors will not only investigate current literature but also report the results of interviews with museum professionals across the breadth of the field on their thoughts and insights about the relationship between their virtual and physical museums. Questions in this domain include: How do physical and virtual museums impact one another? Is there any interaction between the two? Where? In attendance? In audience size and type? In design? The answers provided by this paper will in turn help our field to build a foundation to someday answer even more critical questions. These next questions to research will be ones that surround the unique context of virtual museums- from how a virtual visitor's prior knowledge of the Internet impact their visit to how the medium of an electronic visit impacts exhibition design. This presentation will also help address how to attack the age-old yet never trivial question about outcomes- what do visitors really learn from a virtual museum?"

    "year": "2002",
    "abstract": "The Internet serves as a platform for the production, showcasing and archiving of Digital Art. This developing art form, generated by rapid advances in new media and digital technology, provides a challenge to the researcher studying the field. In particular there are issues for both curator and practitioner concerning temporality, aesthetics, audience and exhibition. Through the AHRB funded 'Digital Arts Curation and Practice' project, virtual exhibitions have been curated at the Digital Cafe of the Watershed Media Centre, Bristol, which have confirmed the Internet as a successful medium for both presenting new works and archiving curated online exhibitions. In particular the Net_Working online exhibition, http://watershed.co.uk/Net_Working, 20-29 November 2001, highlighted the problems of curating such works on a large scale. The exhibition showed over 300 web works covering all forms of artistic practice on the web with submissions coming from places as far flung as Latvia, Thailand, Brazil and California. This exhibition was presented at the CHArt annual conference at the British Academy, UK, 28 November 2001 and was further discussed through interviews with contributing artists from the South West UK region, through online chat arenas and through live link-up between exhibiting artists and delegates at the 4th International Conference of Modern Technology and Processes for Art, Media and Design in Bangkok, 28 November 2001. Net_Working has facilitated researchers the opportunity to fully interrogate the Internet as a live archive of activity in the digital arts. This paper concerns the organisation, categorisation, presentation, evaluation and analysis involved in the curation of 'Net-Working' from selection criteria to methods of presentation. There will be particular focus on the diversity of work apparent in this global exhibition. The paper will further discuss curatorial projects that have developed from this event, the problems of archiving and accessing involved and how the media centre itself has developed new strategies for the presentation and introduction of online work to its visitors. These are all examples contributing to our understanding of changes taking place in the curation and practice of Digital Art."

    "abstract": "Museums of natural history are different from other museums not only in the nature of their collections but also in the amount of fundamental scientific research that they undertake. This paper examines the websites of a number of natural history museums to identify how they give expression to their research, what impression they give of the nature, methods and processes of science, and, in particular, how they explain their work in taxonomy and systematics. Incorporating ? and developing ? approaches used in earlier work, this study analyses websites in key aspects of the nature of science: human activity, enquiry, debate, model making, society and, crucially, the science of systematics. It identifies pertinent examples, both explicit and implicit. The findings presented suggest that there are excellent examples of natural history museum websites taking advantage of the opportunity to present science other than as ?revealed truth?. Some not only provide an extensive resource, but also have been able to communicate their fervour for systematics. However, many others would clearly offer more of benefit to visitors if they gave rather less prominence to their own internal organization and paid correspondingly more attention to basic issues in science."

    "abstract": "This presentation will review the goals, design, outcomes, and the challenges faced by the National Gallery of Art's first online technology initiative for K-12 educators--2001: A Cyberspace Odyssey. As an art museum with a national mandate, the Gallery has long offered educational resources through its Web site. Exhibition literature, virtual tours, teaching packets and activities, and other sources of information for teachers have been staples of the education section of the site. Cyberspace Odyssey, however, marks the first significant effort to provide online teaching resources that are designed by K-12 educators. The program also aims to strengthen teacher's skills and comfort level using technology, while incorporating art into their classroom instruction. The program was thus designed for teachers to explore the potential richness of online resources, to analyze and critique select sites focused on art and education, and establish criteria for good Web site content and design, before beginning to build their own projects. Participation was by application and twelve, three-member teams were selected. Half of these came to the Gallery for a six-day seminar in July 2001, while the other half received the same instruction in August. By the end of each six-day session, teams gave brief presentations on the direction of their projects. Each had a clear focus for their project, with a selection of potential art works from the permanent collections that would support their theme. Upon leaving Washington, teams were charged with continuing their collaboration with teammates through the completion of their Web projects in April of 2001. At that time a panel will select a few of the projects for further development as educational resources on the Gallery's Web site. To support their work in the interim, each team was provided with mentors with whom to consult about the content and technological development of their projects. A password-protected Web site was also established to support program participants, allowing easy reference to project guidelines and deadlines, links to educational resources, participants names and e-mail addresses, and separate work folders into which each team can submit the separate stages of their project."

    "year": "2002",
    "abstract": "In 1606 Duyfken, owned by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and stationed in the East Indies, made a voyage of exploration looking for \"east and south lands\" which took it on the first historically recorded voyage to Australia. As part of bringing Australian history to life, a replica of the Duyfken is currently sailing in the wake of her original predecessor on her way to the Netherlands for the 2002 VOC Celebrations. The website http://www.duyfken.com is the online exhibition of the Duyfken Replica. The website is the only exhibition available when the ship is between ports. It connects to a database through ASP and can be edited dynamically through an HTML administration console on a secure URL. The administrator can upload any data (text, images, QTVR) through this console including the daily logs the captain emails via satellite. The website currently consists of a single English language site sitting on an NT server at WebCentral, an Australian ISP. The Duyfken Foundation wants to translate the entire site into Dutch. This effectively means doubling the site and having both Dutch and English versions sitting side-by-side at WebCentral. In addition, for traffic reasons we want to create a mirror of the entire development (Dutch/English) on an NT server at an ISP in the Netherlands. All this has serious ramifications for the dynamic uploading of data through the administration console. The language issue dictates that there would be more than one person with access and in more than one location and that there could well be a need to have slightly differing information, especially in the areas of \"News & Events\" once the Duyfken has arrived in the Netherlands. However, it is crucial to minimise handling of the data and to safeguard version control and minimise ambiguity with respects to data that needs to be 'the same' across all parts of the development. This will require multiple sets of metadata to be created and maintained. This presents the classic multiple concurrency pattern in managing media artefacts, one of a number of such patterns identified by Valerie Hobbs and Diarmuid Pigott at Murdoch University as part of their research into multimedia databases. These usage patterns and their requisite usage protocols enable a case such as the Duyfken website to be handled in a relatively straightforward manner, despite the disparities in language and time zones. The multiple concurrency pattern solution is presented, as well as several potential extensions to the Duyfken website each with their own patterns (e.g. archiving, reference, education), and a generalised paradigm is presented for a media-rich website management suitable for museums."

    "year": "2002",
    "abstract": "This paper describes an interoperable metadata model, based on international standards, which has been designed to enable the management, description, tracking, exchange and sharing of multimedia resources both within and between cultural institutions. Metadata standards have been developed to describe museum objects (CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model) and to describe multimedia content (MPEG-7) but no standard currently exists for describing museum multimedia content. The Harmony project's ABC model aims to provide a core underlying model to enable a common understanding of metadata terms across disparate domains. This paper describes the ABC ontology and how it has been used to facilitate the merging of the MPEG-7 and CIDOC-CRM models into a single ontology for describing and managing multimedia in museums. The resulting model is demonstrated and evaluated by applying it to a number of typical examples of multimedia museum content. The outcome is an extensible model/standard for describing museum multimedia content which could enable the open exchange and sharing of such resources and a common search interface across multimedia collections distributed across cultural institutions."

The Project WhistleStop site (http://www.whistlestop.org) focuses on digitized educational resources including primary source materials such as: Presidential correspondence, handwritten letters by President Truman, audio files, video clips, as well as interactive games aimed at the K-12 target audience. Similarly, the Truman Library technical staff developed its own web site that focuses on the programs and resources of the Truman Presidential Library and Museum. The web site is located at http://www.trumanlibrary.org. The target audience includes researchers, local citizens, and the general public. Within this site are links to Project WhistleStop, and additional educational offerings aimed at K-12 students. At the conclusion of Project WhistleStop funding, the decision was made to continue both efforts and to create a new site that combines the two separately developed Web sites. The presentation will include technical and design issues, resource identification, and target audience identification. Technical issues include interface design, file naming conventions, navigational considerations, reconciliation of coding languages, and other relevant concerns. The goal of the design team was to unify the \"look , feel and functionality\" of two separately developed Web sites, which had been developed for differing audiences with different funding sources. Decisions relating to resources and content include inclusion, exclusion, and consolidation decisions, and how content and resources will be depicted in the new Web site. The presentation closes with general observations on developing blended Web sites that seek to combine previous efforts done by separate but related entities."

    "year": "2002",
    "abstract": "Information technologies in museums are being touted as the means to create a dynamic interface and intersection between a museum's resources and student/teacher learning. An emerging concern in educational research is how the introduction of information technologies into museums - digitalized artefacts, web-based resources, online professional development for teachers - has spurred both an influx of undocumented learning with museum collections and a wave of pedagogical activities created in isolation to increase 'museum' learning by users. This dual impact of unknown research implications and isolated inquiries that concern the fields of museum studies, educational pedagogy, or information technology design has become a concern for educational researchers. We argue that there has to be greater institutional collaboration and interaction between museum professionals, university researchers, school teachers, students and software designers. This collaboration needs to examine the design, use, and content of web environments as well as the social and educational impacts of information technologies on museum web visitors/users. Critical curriculum theorists advocate the reduction or elimination of overly-structured and predetermined learning paths in pedagogical models such as textbooks. The 'story-board' structure of many museum web sites can create interactions between a visitor and a museum web environment as structured and predetermined as any textbook. This pedagogical model implies that the student or teacher is not being given an active role or enough flexibility in the construction of the exhibit's meaning from their particular perspective and social situation. In a similar manner, social informatics research examines how people use, adapt or reject information technologies in their specific organisational and cultural situations. Social informatics would recommend the student or teacher-user to not be limited to a rigid design path conceived for the delivery of a number of specific outcomes. Museums need to create environments where the user/visitor/learner feels free and permitted to ask questions that will influence their learning in their own way, to relate their stories and experiences in their own chosen manner, and, to share this knowledge and information with the museum, designers and other users. The increasing use of information technologies in museums impacts the educational intent of museums. Yet absent is an in-depth understanding of how information technologies interact with specific publics and the ways that museums deliver their educational intent. Despite evidence that social informatics can impact thinking about learning in museums via websites (Anderson, 1999), there is little research about how museums implement and respond to those teachers and students who use the web technologies. Our concerns are with how students and teachers learn by utilizing the digital resources provided by the museum. This paper draws on comparisons between three museum websites. We examine how each site seeks to better engage and influence teacher and student learning. Through these comparisons, we will show how museum educators, social informatics researchers, and educators need to move beyond their individual disciplines to collaborate with one another and to better understand how their disciplinary theory and research connects with learning for different public audiences. This paper is both focused on how curriculum and social informatics theory can contribute to museum education in a collaborative and reiterative environment. We seek to introduce and discuss the tensions and difficulties that school-based educators (teachers and faculty) face in understanding museum education and social informatics along with museum professionals. We argue that social informatics is both continuous with a tradition of collaboration and discontinuous in that it responds to a different set of conditions under different modes of learning."

For the purpose of renovation the 110 years old building of the main museum will be closed for a few years. The reopening is planned for 2007. Meanwhile the collections are not open for the public. So a new museum, the ?No. 9? will open its virtual showrooms in cyberspace. The virtual museum isn?t just a substitute for the Swiss National Museums but it will have its own identity with a virtual exhibition space, shows, shops, storage, conservation department, online-fundraising, publications, PR, education program and his own docents and trustees. To lead the ?visitor? to a real interactivity on a high quality level will be one of the main goals of this project; to create a permanent attraction in the www another one. For the period of the renovation of the Swiss National Museum in Zuerich the careful defining of long-term strategies are a must for the success of the project. For the MW2002 the author, involved in the planning and realization of the Swiss Virtual Museum, will give an introduction in the design and management of this exceptional project."

    "year": "2002",
    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates and discusses the application of Mixed Raster Content (MRC) compression scheme to digital reproductions of William Blake's hand-colored etchings and engravings. Although Blake is our focus, much of what we have to say and show can be extrapolated to the graphic arts more generally. MRC, for example, has the potential to transform the way we study and represent different states of an engraved plate, and consequently could help retool the genre of the catalogue raisonne for the digital age. More broadly, it is our feeling that the image processing advances presented here will be of interest to humanists working in a variety of image-intensive areas and disciplines, ranging from art history to conservation science to editorial theory. Although we want to underscore the versatility of the technology, the paper takes a case study approach, considering the achievement of MRC within the history of Blake reproduction and editing. Originally developed by Xerox Corporation as a compression scheme to efficiently combine different compression requirements for text and image content in scanned digital documents, MRC is for the first time being deployed to the compression of non-compound documents. Unlike the first installment of the technology, which was a response to composite text and image data, the version of MRC being developed by the co-author is designed with the inherent compositeness of colored prints and other graphic media in mind. The documents we are dealing with, then, are still \"compound\" in the broader, non-technical sense of the term, but the semiological analysis is performed entirely at the level of the image, exclusive of a consideration of text. Used in conjunction with the new JPEG 2000 compression standard, MRC enables not only image compression but also the accurate discrimination of printed intaglio lines from finishing work in colored prints, paving the way for separate processing of each. Whereas other compression models treat the formal content of an image as invariant, MRC is sensitive to the heterogeneous character of the pictorial composition as a whole. By treating printed (engraved and/or etched) lines separately from colored image layers, MRC minimizes image degradation and the inevitable loss of information. The result is superior raster imagery: digital facsimiles that show exceptional fidelity to their prototypes, as a comparison between an original scan of one of Blake's commercial print illustrations and its MRC reconstruction makes evident. Because applied segmentation can essentially lift the color overlay of an impression, it additionally provides the student of Blake the unique opportunity to recreate the underlying copperplate image and model the artist's coloring process. A visual demonstration of MRC can be found at (http://henry.ee.rochester.edu:8080/~misicv/CTLTR/CTLTR.PPT) [ed. note: URL invalid - http://henry.ee.rochester.edu:8080/~misicv/CTLTR/CTLTR.PPT - Ocotber 29, 2008]."

    "abstract": "The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston recently received a $750,000 grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to provide integrated, online access to its archives documenting its Egyptian excavations at Giza, directed by George A. Reisner between 1902 and 1942. Over a four-year period (2000-2004), the Giza Archives Project will convert excavation diaries, historic glass plate expedition photographic negatives, object register books, maps, plans and sketches from the excavations at Giza into electronic format to be accessed through the Internet (demo at the Museum's website at www.mfa.org). While the print publications of the \"Giza Mastabas Series\" will continue, this project represents a new approach to Egyptological \"publishing\" in the widest sense of the word. It aims to streamline and enhance scholarly research in the face of rising traditional printing costs, lagging publication schedules and reduced budgets for Egyptological pursuits. It is also an experiment in reintegrating the various elements of ancient material culture and modern archaeological documentation that are naturally \"dissected\" during the archaeological process. Artifacts and documentation, separated by their different types of media (statues, inscriptions, survey maps, images), by geographical distance (Giza, Boston, Cairo) can for the first time be united virtually, allowing for research approaches that were previously impossible. A selection of the new technologies currently being investigated for the forthcoming Giza website will be discussed."

The ramp that is being built is proving popular among many users beyond the community for whom it was first requested. Good practice has ramps integrated into the design of buildings and Web sites from the start, and everyone can feel equally welcome and share in the experiences provided beyond the ramp. The same practices can be adopted on the Web, but often the question is what the best virtual experience that will provide for all inclusively is. The authors argue a range of forms and modalities of resources should be provided to ensure accessibility and richness for all users."

It presents the practical aspects from a collection documentation point of view, slotting in the relevant technical language and web jargon. It is based on the experience of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG), the smallest of Australia's state museums and unique amongst them in that it is a combined art, social history and natural history museum, and includes Tasmania's state herbarium. We regard ourselves as small because in the museum collection world our individual collections are small. Our problems and solutions are nearer those of the small museum than the large. We use volunteers for data entry, we think twice before expending $500 and we have an obligation (by Act of Parliament) to provide information to our public. At the other end we need to comply with government and discipline metadata standards, and are part of Australia's national collection projects including Australian Museums On Line (AMOL), Australian Virtual Herbarium (AVH) and the burgeoning consolidated access to Australia's biological collections with the working title OZCAM. This paper covers the practicalities of developing collection databases then publishing and maintaining the information on the web using limited resources. It considers first, the two ends of the process, getting the information organised into a database and maintaining it on the web. Secondly, it considers the technological questions in between. Specifically, it uses the cross-platform, application FileMaker Pro as an example of a readily available database package that small museums can use to produce a whole solution or as a stepping stone to greater things."

    "abstract": "A group of research projects based at HP-Labs Bristol, the University of Bristol and ARKive (a new large multimedia database project focused on the worlds biodiversity based in the UK) are working to develop a flexible model for the indexing of multimedia collections that allows users to 'annotate' content utilising extensible controlled vocabularies. As part of the educationally focused ARKive-ERA project a series of models for user annotation have been developed. The need for these types of user support and tools was identified while conducting pre-design stage user studies with specialist user groups. The needs centre around the limitations of current on-line museum and library systems that do not provide support for users to annotate or 'tag' multimedia objects of relevance to their particular community of interest or with specialised indexing terms. This would enable specialised resource discovery and knowledge sharing with other members of their communities. One example is that of University Lecturers and Researchers studying a particular type of animal behaviour. They may wish to identify all relevant images or video of that particular behaviour and annotate them as good illustrations of aspects of that behaviour. However significant issues arise over for example, the validation of information, access control and the use of such annotations by the resource discovery tools. The paper explores these and other issues and problems involved and how the various models can help provide solutions to the key problems and thus meet the needs of a diverse range of 'communities of interest' and adding significant value to on-line multimedia collections."

    "abstract": "The museums that flourished in the nineteenth century focused on the accumulation, annotation, and arrangement of artifacts within special-purpose museum buildings. Today, digital technology is supporting new ways of putting together artifacts, physical space, and information. The artifacts may be digital rather than physical -- digital images rather than photographs on paper, for example. Annotations may be multimedia rather than textual, they may be much more extensive than in the past, and they can potentially do a much better job of contextualizing exhibits. Arrangements of digital artifacts may be dynamic -- sorted and searched in a wide variety of ways -- rather than static, as in a traditional gallery. The display space may be dispersed rather than clustered in a central location, and it may be established by location-sensitive navigation systems rather than gallery walls. And acquisition of an artifact may mean gaining digital access rights rather than purchasing or negotiating a loan then transporting a physical artifact. All this adds up to a major transformation of the museum building type. In this talk I shall briefly survey the history of museum buildings, explore the forces driving current transformations, and suggest some future directions."

Awaiting funding, this project will be trailed later this year. African storytelling traditions support communal ownership of stories and involve multiple forms of expression: mime, dance, music as well as verbal narrative. The South African project considers how the internet can be utilised to support and enhance these forms of storytelling with authors in the South and North. The paper considers parameters of community involvement in widely differing socio-economic contexts. Township involvement includes extending storytelling workshops at community centres to the web. Focusing on technology transfer, the paper also considers the relationship between central museums developed within the apartheid system with newly established community centres on the periphery of urban centres. It reviews the need for changes to established museums in the post-apartheid period with a particular emphasis on incorporating black history and contemporary oral history into social and cultural museums, both physical and web-based, in South Africa."

    "abstract": "Museums world-wide are deploying both virtual exhibits and multimedia collections for use by researchers, educators and the general public. With today\\'s technology, users searching for thematic information from multiple autonomous sites must perform a series of separate processes to locate a reference list to relevant sites, search each site for relevant information, extract relevant data, and construct a local collection for ?off-line? development of an integrated presentation. The users? problem can be summarized as a need for methods and tools to assist in locating, accessing, and extracting relevant information from multimedia, multi-database systems developed and maintained by autonomous museums. Two principal problems hinder support for location and access to multiple data sources. First, there is a lack of agreement on how semantically consistent metadata for description of data collections should be created. Thereafter a user-friendly query language and processing system must be developed to support the formulation of search criteria, search in a multi-database space, and integrate and present the search results. This paper presents the motivation, goals, and approach taken for a newly started project that aims to develop methods and tools to address these problems by integrating and extending existing methods and tools developed separately for metadata, multimedia, and multi-database management. The primary goal is to develop a system to support dynamic generation of specialized collections as the result of an easy-to-use query language to multiple museum collections, i.e. a system to support exhibits-on-demand."

    "abstract": "Museum web sites are distinctive animals in the world of the web. To be successful, they must meet a variety of needs which range from satisfying the basics, like mentioning hours of operation, to providing food for thought on say, changing the world or maybe just contemporary culture as we know it. On top of this, museum sites constantly evolve depending on exhibitions, field research or events going on in the physical world. How can one design unite all this information? Further, as a designer, how do you even start? This paper exposes the re-design and information architecture process undertaken to recreate the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site. Various aspects of the process will be discussed: developing thumbnail sketches for the look and architecture of the site; collaborating harmoniously with numerous colleagues from all arms of the museum; analyzing inspirational sites; incorporating vast quantities of information in a non-repetitive way, attempting to give a web visitor the 'museum' experience; and most importantly bringing the content to bear. There was a time when even the simple addition of content (bulk) to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site only served to make it unwieldy and reveal an awkward organization of information. A significant transformation was inevitable. The desire, of course, was to change from a creature of vital functions to one of elegance."

Collections management systems present a picture of the physical collection of a museum and have long been employed to manage them. Now museums are facing new experiences by introducing Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies that catalogue, track and protect their intangible interests relating to the physical collection. Before considering, purchasing and/or customizing DRM technology, however, museums must first determine the breadth, depth and flexibility of their intangible assets. This mini-workshop will examine DRM technologies, and the type of collection audit required in order to gather the necessary information needed to catalogue the intangible assets of a museum. It will define museum intangibles as determined through the experiences of both authors and through formal and informal surveys and will propose a list of issues to cover in any information audit on museums' intangible assets."

    "abstract": "Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of visitor experience in museums has a proud and well established tradition. Long before ?customer relationship management? became a ubiquitous catch cry, museums were engaged in rigorous and sophisticated analyses of their audiences. Similarly, museums have also been at the forefront of developments in online content delivery. Yet, the culture of rigorous evaluation applied to traditional visitor research is not nearly so apparent in the online museum environment. As competition amongst online content providers becomes more intense, museums need to embrace a more rigorous approach to understanding and developing their web audiences. Building on our established traditions of audience evaluation, museums can once again lead the way in developing understandings of how visitors explore and engage with content in the new realm of virtual experience. Web log analysis is an under-utilised approach to understanding and testing visitor behaviour on the web. Every visit to a site leaves a potentially rich vein of information for any willing data miner. Utilising that data effectively to understand the visitor's experience is essential to building web sites that work. The National Museum of Australia is using the analysis of web log data to inform the redesign of its online presence. Using new analysis tools, historical log data is being mined to test hypotheses about user behaviour and to develop new approaches to site structure and design. As the new site is implemented web log data will be used as the basis for the ongoing study of changing patterns of visitor behaviour."

An introductory video is presented at the entrance to each exhibition room. Drop down text panels provide information on the objects, as well as on Inuit artists and the Canadian North. To produce the exhibition, three technologies developed for Web applications - VRML, 3D Scanning and QuickTime - were used. While these technologies enable museums to produce interactive web exhibitions, a number of significant technical and web design issues must be considered.

    "abstract": "This paper reports on the development of a prototype authoring tool developed as part of on-going research around the needs of the ARKive project. The project holds text, rich-media and descriptions of factual statements about bio-diversity and conservation information. A key user community is that of school age children, requiring the mark-up of educational metadata in open standards such as IEEE LOM. A previous paper by the authors reported on the publishing architecture for this project. This publishing architecture is intended to serve a range of audiences (ages, language and level of language skills). By storage of the content as discrete units, with extensive metadata describing each one, units may be retrieved and served to the audience as appropriate. Future developments may extend this to support ad hoc queries, not just rigidly pre-defined standard pages. Authoring development has shown that a simple and pragmatic tool based on Microsoft Word may still address advanced technologies such as RDF, DAML and the future of the Semantic Web. Careful design has separated the process of describing a museum's exhibits, and the problem domain of the museum's area of interest. This gives two advantages. First, most of the effort now supports a generic on-line museum that may be re-targeted from bio-diversity to any other topic. Secondly, solving the problem domain by ontological descriptions, not rigid program code, gives the ability to easily reference pre-existing or external vocabularies. This improves the flexibility of solving the initial problem, allows the same code to be re-used on other projects, and assists publishing into other metadata formats."

OAI-PMH supports standardized exchange of metadata describing items in disparate collections such as those held by museums and libraries. This paper describes recent work done by the University of Illinois Library, recipient of one of seven OAI-related grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. An overview is given of the process used to export metadata records describing holdings of the Spurlock Museum at the University of Illinois. These metadata records were initially created to help track artifacts as they were procured, stored, and displayed and now are used also to support end-user searching via the Spurlock Museum Website. Spurlock metadata records were mapped to Dublin Core (DC) and then harvested into the Illinois project's metadata repository. The details of the processes used to transform the Spurlock records into OAI compliant metadata and the lessons learned during this process are illustrative of the work necessary to make museum collections available using OAI-PMH. Assuming institutions like Spurlock make metadata available, what then can be done with these information resources? We discuss the OAI-based search and discovery services being developed by the University of Illinois. Issues such as need for normalization of metadata, importance of presenting search results in context, and difficulties caused by institution-to-institution variations in metadata authoring practices are discussed."

    "abstract": "The museum wearable is a real time storytelling device: it is a museum guide which in real time evaluates the visitor's preferences by observing his/her path and length of stops along the museum's exhibit space, and selects content from a large database of available movie clips, audio, and animations. Through the use of this device a museum visit is augmented with video commentary: the video story overlaps with and comments upon the user's real-world viewing, and gradually unfolds as wearers wander around the space. The wearable is made by a lightweight and small computer that people carry inside a shoulder pack. It offers an audiovisual augmentation of the surrounding environment using a small eye-piece display (often called private eye) attached to conventional headphones. The private eye display is placed in front of one eye while the other eye is free to see the user's surroundings. When wearing the display, after a few seconds of adaptation, the user's brain assembles the world's image seen by one eye with the display's image seen by the other eye, into a fused augmented reality viewing. The museum wearable identifies three visitor types: busy, greedy, and selective, which have been selected as the essential museum visitor types from the museum literature. It uses a custom-made long range and wide coverage infrared location sensor to gather tracking information about the visitor's path in the museum's gallery. The museum wearable provides more than a simple associative coupling between inputs and outputs. The sensor inputs, coming from the long range indoors infrared positioning system, are coupled to digital media outputs via a user model, and estimated probabilistically by a Bayesian network. The ability to coordinate and present the visual material as a function of the visitor's estimated type (i.e. busy, greedy, or selective types, or other appropriate types), seamlessly, timely, and in conjunction with the path of the wearer inside the exhibit, is an important innovative aspect of this device. Bayesian networks also have the additional advantage that they allow to encapsulate our human knowledge about the context of use of the museum wearable (a particular exhibit, a trade show) as nodes of the network. The museum wearable fuses together the audiovisual documentary which illustrates and extends an exhibit, with the visitor's path inside that exhibit, using a wearable computer. By having the public use this device, museums can accomplish multiple goals simultaneously: they can have objects narrate their own story; they do not needs special rooms to show audiovisual explanations about the exhibit as with the wearable the narrative is unfolded by the visitor's path in the museum; they can show more artwork that what is physically on display, by showing video, images, audio, and text about other important objects for the exhibit; they do not need to disseminate panels with textual explanation or video monitors along the ailes of the exhibit as that information can now be tailored to each individual visitor; they can personalize the audiovisual explanations provided to the public based on the visitors' type and exploration strategy. With respect to the traditional museum audio tour the museum wearable introduces the following innovations: it does not constrain the visitor to follow a predefined sequential path in the museum but it relies in its sensing system to find the visitor's location and respond consequently; it adds a layer of visual augmentation and not just auditory; through Bayesian network based user modeling it provides personalized content to each visitor, as a function of the estimated visitor type."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in wireless network technologies create the potential to significantly enhance the experience of a visit to a museum. On the exhibit floor, visitors carrying wirelessly connected portable devices can be given opportunities for exploration, sharing, explanations, context, background, analytical tools, and suggestions for related experiences. When these devices are part of a Web-based network, they can help extend the museum visit: in advance, through activities that orient visitors, and afterward, through opportunities to reflect and explore related ideas. The Electronic Guidebook project is a study of users equipped with such technologies, conducted by the Exploratorium in partnership with researchers at Hewlett-Packard Labs. The project has investigated how a Web-based computing infrastructure can provide museum visitors with an augmented museum experience, so that they can better plan their visit, get the most out of it while they are in the museum, and be able to refer back to their visit once they have returned to their home or classroom. The goal is to understand what technological infrastructure supports this extended museum experience, and to obtain preliminary data on how different aspects of the technologies, and the content delivered through them, affects engagement with the exhibits and pre- or post-visit learning activities. The project deployed and tested a network using a variety of handheld computers and radio-frequency identification tags to link visitors with exhibit-related content delivered by a Web-based server. Users in the study were able to access Web-based content, including text, images, video, and audio, during a visit. In addition, they were able to construct a record of their visit by bookmarking exhibit content, creating images, notations, and other artifacts and to access it on a personal Web page in the museum or following their visit. In this paper, presenters will provide results of the study and discuss promising avenues of future research on Web-based networks."

    "abstract": "The first “W” in the acronym “WWW” as we all know stands for “world.” Most Museum Web sites -- and for that matter most of any kind of Web site in the United States -- offer very little in languages other than English. This is understandable. Our main audience is English speaking. However, there are opportunities, when we seek them, to reach out to audiences in languages other than English. This paper presents one such opportunity. In it, I will discuss how the project came about, why we made a decision to translate parts of the site into two other languages, what it took in terms of technology to successfully display these languages, and the results of our decision. The Web site presented is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Holocaust Era in Croatia: Jasenovac 1941-1945\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (www.ushmm.org/jasenovac). The decision was made to translate this Web site into the Serbian and Croatian languages. The Serbian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet while Croatian uses the Latin alphabet, but with its own diacritics. But our endeavor was even greater than the adding of these two languages for we also made the editorial decision to represent in the English text the foreign diacritics when appropriate, for example, with the word “Ustasa.” This paper will present the point of view that the effort was worthwhile, but that to really be effective a variety of Museum staff -- from fundraising to communications -- must be involved."

    "abstract": "Bellevue Art Museum combines a contemporary art museum with a school, art studio and community center. The interpretive methodology reflects the multi-faceted nature of the organization. The Museum relies heavily on a fusion of contextual information, interactive teaching methods, hands-on art experiences, and 150 knowledgeable docents. The Docent Extranet Project at Bellevue Art Museum was conceived to increase the administrative efficiency of the docent program, to improve staff/docent communications and relations, and to culminate in a positive impact on the visitor experience. The Docent Extranet is a private network intended to bring information to the docent, rather than making the docent search for the information. In a cooperative effort to replace the old \"binder\" system, Museum staff, consultants and docents are shifting the docent business paradigm, using web technology to provide new ways of learning, teaching, researching and communicating. The wide scope and challenging nature of this project became clear early on in the planning process. The extranet includes online initiatives such as tour and gallery duty scheduling, research materials and resources, administrative documentation, online forms and continuing education opportunities. This paper will examine the actual process of developing the Docent Extranet from the project management viewpoint including: technical specifications, project participants' roles and responsibilities, user interface and design, training methods, evaluation and future plans."

    "abstract": "Along the south side of the Palace of The Governors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, sit Native American artists and craftspeople who sell their handmade goods to tourists and local Santa Feans almost every day of the year, rain or shine. The over 900 vendors represent forty-one tribes, pueblos, chapters and villages in New Mexico, the Navajo Nation, and some parts of Arizona. Each morning the Vendors Committee conducts a lottery to see who will occupy the eighty spaces available under the portal that day. The Vendors Committee creates and enforces rules for those who sell their work under the portal. The rules emphasize authenticity (a maker's mark is required on all goods), traditional materials (sterling silver is permitted; silver plate and commercial liquid silver is not), and handmade work made as generations of Indian artisans have made it. Because of space limitations, the distances that many of the vendors must drive to participate in the lottery for a space under the portal, and the vagaries of clientele and weather, the Portal Program has sought alternate venues to sell their goods. The Portal Program's coordinator has raised the vendor's interest in the Internet as a viable \"location\" that could expand their market as well as accomplish other significant goals. These goals include education and member training. The vendors want the world to know what defines authentic Indian art. They also want non-Native people to have greater understanding about the diverse cultures and art traditions represented in the Portal Program. Finally, the artist-vendors recognize that they need training in the use of electronic media in order to expand their income potential. It is appropriate, if ironic, that contemporary technology can work so effectively to preserve traditional American art forms and cultures by serving a population that is underserved, rural, and unique."

    "abstract": "As Digital technologies bring museums, libraries, and archives together to enhance learning by providing access to digitized primary and secondary cultural resources along with the more traditional bibliographic materials. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University Library and the College of Education are developing a collaborative program that integrates digital primary source materials into K-12 curriculum and the educational programs of museums and libraries. Teaching with Digital Content-Describing, Finding and Using Digital Cultural Heritage Materials (http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc) is a two-year project funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Through this project, we are introducing a broad group of K-12 teachers, museum curators, educators, and librarians to digital cultural heritage materials. Our goal is to provide them with training and professional development activities to enable use of primary source materials in the classroom and in museum and library education programs. In this paper, we will describe the collaborative Teaching with Digital Content project and show how the educators are using on-line materials in their learning environments. Using digitized primary source materials involves fundamental shifts in the philosophies, service methods, and pedagogies of museum curators, librarians, and teachers, specific to particular audiences and intents. We are introducing a broad group of teachers to digital cultural heritage materials by partnering with several outreach programs in the University of Illinois College of Education, such as curriculum and instruction courses to secondary social studies student teachers, the Moveable Feast program, which provides technology training for K-12 teachers, and concept-based training for teachers, curators and librarians in the use of visual materials. Museums and libraries assist teachers by placing digital objects in their historical context by utilizing innovative technologies to present this information and by identifying and helping teachers locate and utilize other digital resources that are freely accessible in electronic form. Similarly, the teachers provide the museums and libraries with specific requests for cultural heritage objects for their curriculum planning, development and implementation. The Teaching with Digital Content project presents numerous pedagogical issues for the teachers, curators, and librarians. This project requires a continuous collaboration between the individuals and groups, and through on-line discussions, requests, and in-service events, reiterative revisions prompt the ongoing site and curricular development. This collaboration brings the groups together to discuss utilizing digital cultural objects, what knowledge is available about the object from the institutions, as well as how the exchange of knowledge will extend student learning framed within state-based standards. What results from the institutional and state educational standards are tensions between the ideological and pragmatic purposes that influences the projects development, use, and results. This presentation will introduce, examine, and discuss various issues that form a part of our collaborative project."

    "abstract": "In May of 2001, the Exhibition Program at the National Library of Medicine opened The Once and Future Web: Worlds Woven by the Telegraph and Internet. The Library provides an unusual environment for the Exhibition Program because it is not a museum and therefore allows a lot of freedom but provides little preexisting structure for exhibitions. The challenge of displaying and interpreting communications technology provided the Exhibition Program with an opportunity to explore the power of multimedia interactives. These interactives both make use of and demonstrate the power of digital age communications technology by confronting the visitor with various digital media. One of the most powerful advantages of digitization is the ability to combine many different source media, including digital artifacts in their own medium, into a consistent, easily navigable experience. In The Once and Future Web, eleven touch-screen interactive stations deliver text, images, audio, video, and a searchable glossary, providing user-selected content relevant at that point in the narrative. Visitors can also email a Morse-coded message or a digitally manipulated picture of themselves. People can participate in a virtual conversation with one of the leaders of the Internet community, and see a demonstration of \"virtual anatomy\". In addition, visitors can relax in a centrally located Digital Lounge, which provides limited Internet access and displays an Internet art program. The area is made informal with chairs, tables, and topical reading materials."

    "abstract": "This paper argues that museums do not have a natural role in the distribution of net art, that the conservation tradition and expertise of museums do not make them suited for creating historical collections of net art without undergoing major upgrading, and that older art institutions have shown a superficial understanding of net art. Other relevant institutions already have established themselves on the Internet. Although net art does not need museums, one can still see how museums of contemporary art need net art. Public museums of contemporary art are meant to cover the whole field of contemporary art, and therefore they must necessarily also cover net art. If museums have to take net art seriously, they have to start with the already established competencies and viable forums outside the museums. Museums that wish to cover net art should join these forums. For the sake of the reputation of museums in the net art environment, it is essential that they do not appear to be parasites or lusers* - mere users of net art who just download the resulting works of art without contributing to their structural strengthening and the more process-oriented development. * Luser: term used in hacker environments about people who merely use - and do not contribute to - the development of open programs."

These 3D game engines offer greater versatility, usability, maturity, simulation and codebase than most current 3D realtime frameworks. At the University of Aizu, we are using the Quake engine in conjunction with the Povray raytracing engine to attack the problem of visualization and simulation from two sides. We have modeled a temple from northern Japan that users can experience in realtime. However, to deal with the limitations of simulation in realtime, we have added the ability for users to select a view for greater detail. The selected view is rendered in the background as the users continue to travel through the temple, and is delivered in a separate window when finished. Our paper will describe relevant game paradigms, their usefulness, and our work in detail, including problems and solutions we have discovered along the way, and conclude with suggestions on how this work could assist museums and educators in simulation and modeling."

Clear, regular communication is key to success. Good working relationships between staff in our Education and Technology Divisions, and talented, supportive managers have ensured that our projects are successful. This presentation uses Teacher Workshops Online as a model to show how content and technology work together to produce an educational website for a museum, using pedagogical standards, museum standards, project management, and technology. Teacher Workshops Online is a project that involves Education and Technology staff cooperating to create pedagogical lessons and practical classroom examples, using the Museum's educational resources, for teaching the Holocaust for middle and high school educators."

    "abstract": "The National Endowment for the Humanities along with NEA and the Rockefeller Foundation awarded funding to the Mint Museum to develop an integrated project that could become the definitive work related to one of the most pervasive but little understood aspects of pre-columbian cultures - the ballgame. The idea was to organize a traveling exhibition that was supplemented not only by a catalogue, but also by a large scale and comprehensive educational web site. The approach pursued produced an outcome that is more than the sum of the three individual parts. The traveling exhibition is the result of years of international negotiations and research. It represents the first time that many of the most valued artifacts related to the ballgame have appeared in one place. The catalogue includes eleven articles written by leading scholars in this field and over 150 pages of color photographs. It is the most definitive work to date on the history of the ballgame and its relevance to modern society. The educational web site is a comprehensive treatment of the subject that is accessible to school children and scholars alike. It presents an educational context for understanding the exhibition and catalogue that greatly enhances both the museum and catalogue experience. The paper and presentation will include the results of a series of interviews with school children, teachers and members of the general public that describe the many ways that the educational web site helped enhance the overall exhibition experience."

    "abstract": "By their nature and mission, science museums believe that access to primary objects can spark meaningful learning. With the world wide web, access to those primary objects is greater than ever before. With the web, the challenge for museum staff to provide educational interpretation of those objects is also greater than ever before. The Franklin Institute believes that outstanding educators can provide important educational perspective for the collections-based resource initiatives at museums. The premise is that the end user is likely to be the best interpreter in the online museum exhibition process. The advent of the world wide web has broadened access to Museum collections in ways never before imagined. Mere digitization of objects is not the greatest challenge; rather, the greatest challenge is the meaningful educational use of the objects. How will educators make use of online exhibitions? How can primary objects be instigators of inquiry in formal science education programs? In order to answer these questions, real action research is needed. In 1998, The Franklin Institute, in affiliation with the Science Learning Network, organized its first group of action researchers, known originally as the \"online fellows,\" and now known as Online Museum Educators. Since that time, thirteen educators from across the US and Canada have participated, sharing their perspective and talent. This year, a chapter of six additional Online Museum Educators, based at the Science Museum, London, has been initiated to broaden the base of experience and to test the process model in another museum. The initial findings suggest that primary objects can and do instigate inquiry in the creative teacher's classroom. The challenge that still lies ahead is to produce and test a content design model for wider use by online museums that is standardized enough to motivate similar activity in all classrooms, across cultures. That challenge is being addressed by the project in the current academic year, and progress to date will be reported at the conference."

Using teachers' curriculum units and the Illinois State Board of Education Learning Standards for Social Sciences as a framework, curators, librarians and archivists identify primary source materials from their collections for inclusion in a Web-based database to be used in third, fourth and fifth grade classrooms. The DCHC provides a means for museums, libraries and archives to identify common ground among their collections, and to provide schools with digital access to these materials. The Early American Museum (EAM) joined the DCHC out of a desire to digitize and increase electronic access to its collections. In this paper, we will discuss both the initial aims and goals of the DCHC from the standpoint of a large university library responsible for administering the project, as well as from the perspective of a smaller participant museum. We will discuss the artifact selection process for the database, and the implementation of a single database for a wide variety of collections, with particular reference to how the database design was viewed by the Early American Museum.

The system determines the group of links appropriate to the user(s) and shows them in a resultant HTML page. In addition, SAGRES enables cooperative learning by supporting interaction among users and also among members of groups of users. Users in SAGRES are aided by personal assistants that are software agents, whose purpose is to monitor the visitors actions, helping them during the navigation. Considering studies in human-computer interaction (Ball et al, 1997) (Koda, 1996) and aiming to provide a friendlier interface for the SAGRES system, the agents have a graphical representation as animate characters. These characters improvise a group of behaviours similar to human behaviours (happiness, satisfaction and vibration), making the interaction more attractive. In order to evaluate the user's degree of satisfaction with the agents, we developed a questionnaire and obtained some favorable results. This system is developed in the Museu de Ciências e Tecnologia (MCT) at Pontificia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), Porto Alegre, Brazil."

Issues raised in this report have direct relation to museums: will we collect digital objects? how will we integrate those collections with traditional museum materials (either as originals or surrogates or both)? how can things as impermament as websites be saved? More of the issues have indirect impact: the need to consider preservation, understanding guidelines for digital quality, managing digital content. Using the LC21 report as a springboard, this paper will look at the current sense of what constitutes a workable digital strategy, those areas where standards and descriptions of best practices are or are not developing, a sense of where museums as experts in management of information can add to the discussions and where they can learn from the experience of others. The goal of the paper is to come to a clearer understanding of where we are and where we are going, not only from the perspective of individual museums and their projects but from the perspective of our discipline as a whole."

Digitizing, however, is only a first step. Many libraries, archives, or other cultural heritage institutions already have a well functioning Library Information System (LIS) for the metadata management of their conventional objects. These systems work satisfactory as far as standard museum functions are concerned, such as cataloging, indexing, acquisition, or the OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog). What is however needed now are the administration and maintenance of the digital objects themselves. In this aspect, traditional Library Information Systems have limitations and shortcomings. In our paper we present a global requirement list for a Digital Library System and we develop a generic architecture. We put special emphasis on an integrated solution, which addresses all aspects of a publication chain, from digitization, over indexing, administration, Web presentation, printing, to electronic commerce. We describe state-of-the-art Digital Library Systems with their benefits, disadvantages, limitations, and possible fields of application. On this information basis we describe our approach to find an integrated Digital Library Solution."

The cultural, government and private sectors have hyped the need for an on-line presence, especially where the web is seen as a virtual team building experience that crosses geographical and other boundaries. While there can be few arguments against the potential of the web to offer this experience, the question of web rationale or integrity of representation has only recently come into question. Lucille Bell, Content Coordinator for the Haida First Nations, and Sylvia Grace Borda, Project Manager for the Haida website, will comment on their experiences about creating, critiquing, and liaising with a consortium of partners which included local museums within British Columbia, Haida First Nations Tribal Council and Peoples, the Canadian government and Expo Pavilion designers. In particular, the speakers will outline the in-depth processes (joint decisions) which developed into and allowed for an open, educational and virtual dialogue across the geographical and cultural boundaries that separated the team members, and the subsequent challenges of representing these boundaries in a unified way (politically and artistically) to an international audience. Areas for discussion will include: 1) The selection of a multimedia team. Haida First Nations as content developers, and anthologists/government as web designers. The balance of representation, perception and views. Lucille Bell will offer direct input about her experiences from a Haida First Nations' perspective. 2) Critiquing the web site creation process. Particular emphasis will focus on the structure and dynamics of the feedback mechanisms which were put in place during the various stages of production. 3) Web viewer engagement - the organizational and web design methods selected in order to represent, for example, the views of Haida First Nations in the areas of song, dance, gaming, and politics. Incorporation of language and design elements for a multi-lingual/multi-cultural audience."

As a result, it operates as the leading research and resource center for the subject in the country. The collections have been Designated of national importance and are now in receipt of a grant from the UK government-funded Designation Challenge Fund for a project designed to greatly enhance access to the collections via the World Wide Web. The aim is to have a dynamic, database-driven website which will present a thematic route of entry for exploration of the collections. This collections access project aims to make the information available to a variety of users in an appropriate manner. Specifically targeted users are primary school children (and teachers), the general public (including secondary school children) and expert researchers (e.g., from academia). Different interfaces are provided within the website to accommodate these various types of user in the INTERnet Farm And Countryside Explorer (INTERFACE) section designated as schools, public and advanced users. For example, story-based environments are being included, extracting information from the database. The stories themselves are being generated by hand as static pages based on templates, but the database can be used at any time to include further information on objects or areas of interest. Primary school children can be limited to records that include graphical images, with access via story-based presentations suitable for use as educational resources, with associated teacher support. The public interface provides hierarchical exploration of subject areas. For experts, a more traditional form-based database interface with many fields will provide access to the full database. One of the key considerations in developing on-line content for museums is bringing together collection management systems and exhibition information into one system. The manner in which collections are integrated into websites is likely to have implications for their accessibility. For example, the location of the access to collections within the overall site and the graphic presentation of the interface may influence visitors' search and navigation behavior. This paper includes information on an evaluation approach that was developed as part of the initial stages of the project. The objectives of the initial evaluation were to identify other sites which provide access to a collections database; to observe how functionality has been implemented; to consider which aspects of the interfaces may be adopted or adapted for the project. The outcome of the evaluations is described, identifying strengths and weaknesses of existing sites. As the sample of sites analyzed is small, this data is discussed in relation to potential uses for this methodology. A technical evaluation of the first version of the new website is also included. The last part of the paper gives an overview of what is planned for the last part of the project. Not many museum collections are available on-line in a comprehensive form, especially from smaller museums, so this project aims to be exemplary of what can be achieved given appropriate resources."

    "abstract": "The Seattle Art Museum's \"My Art Gallery\" Web site was born out of an actual experiment in the galleries of the museum itself. The project was called \"Growing Up With Art\" and was funded by a four-year grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts. SAM invited sixth-grade classes from local schools into the museum to curate two exhibitions using the museum's permanent collection. It was a project requiring collaboration from many corners of the institution - curators, educators, and registrars - as well as teachers and students in the public schools. Achieving an actual exhibition in the museum's galleries after only a ten-week lesson was an ambitious goal. Educators and a curatorial associate developed lessons for the students that would take them step by step through a \"curatorial process.\" This process was designed to incorporate key elements of a curator's exhibition-development process and to tie into a sixth-grade curriculum as well as Washington State learning objectives. The very nature of this project was clearly experimental and brought up many issues within the museum about the display of art and the role of the museum in relation to its community. Because of the intense time commitment and expense required for the project, the museum was able to give this experience to only a limited group of sixth-grade students. Not wanting to retire our efforts to the archives, we turned to the Internet as a way to extend a version of the unique experience to a wider audience. As the project was winding down, SAM had completed the transfer of its object collection data to a new system, allowing the data to be accessed through the Web. Using the Web to engage our audience with the permanent collection became a new possibility. The idea was to build a Web site where students could be introduced to the elements of the curatorial process online: a process of visual analysis that includes observation, questioning, research, comparison, and label writing. Students, specifically in grades 6-10, could create a virtual exhibition by choosing from the group of works used in the actual student-curated exhibition and writing the results of their research and observations into a database-driven notebook. The notes and images would then dynamically generate html pages displaying their work. As a reward, students could pick their own gallery backdrops for their exhibition and send \"gallery opening\" emails to friends and family. This paper will explore the transformation of classroom curriculum into an engaging, Web-friendly, interactive experience, pointing out the Web-management and structural-design challenges that were faced to achieve this goal. Similar to the program that resulted in the physical exhibitions, the Web site project was ambitious; it required museum staff to work collaboratively and face new issues that were pushed to the forefront by this medium."

    "abstract": "Leonardo's enigmatic Mona Lisa portrait, painted in the 1500's, coupled with numerous researched museum links served as the cultural catalyst for an ongoing evolving inner city Bronx high school student web research project. Begun in 1997, as part of the ThinkQuest Challenge, for developing a collaborative web project focused around a particular problem construct \"Why is the Mona Lisa Smiling?\" in partnership with peers from Borlange Sweden initially reacted, responded and reflected on Lillian Schwartz's research about the identity of Mona Lisa. Schwartz's contention, that Mona was Leonardo himself, led the students to include museum resources as part of their scientific inquiry into the validity of Schwartz's compelling thesis. The inner city Bronx HS students who created the web site had little if any personal experiences visiting actual Museum Resources in culturally rich NYC; but through the research process involved in investigating Schwartz's theory, students became online virtual museum visitors, Among the Museum Web Sites they toured and integrated within the project were: Getty Museum, Boston Science Museum, Science and Technology Museum of Milan, The Vatican, The Exploratorium, Franklin Institute and The Smithsonian Institution. In turn, the students museum explorations enriched and expanded their initial Why is the Mona Lisa Project, which grew to include further aspects of Leonardo's talents visions and Inventions and connections to other artists and scientists. These were identified in the Museum collection through virtual museum visits. Indeed in May 2000, when Microsoft issued its NYC Beyond 2000 Challenge, the Bronx HS Students confidently selected the arts arena as the content area for their ArtiFAQ 2100 Web Project. They were able to use museum web resource to address the challenge by using museums to look back in Art History. The then built on the achievements of art history to predict art social trends 2100. These predictions are presented in the form of Digital Art Creations."

    "abstract": "This paper describes a model for the use of the Web to engage communities in better understanding and appreciation of cultures through partnership among a knowledge organization, K-12 teachers and learners, museums, and regional and virtual communities. Museums and other content providers offer artefacts for object-based learning. Content specialists contribute specialized content expertise and evaluate resources. Education specialists develop, evaluate, and use materials for instruction. Information specialists identify, evaluate, organize, and promote the use of web-based and other information resources. They also develop tools to capture and display content, to engage the teachers and learners in dialogue, and to reach out and extend the content and resources to both local and virtual communities. Communication tools enable members of the local as well as virtual communities to provide reflections and engage in dialogue, as well as to contribute their own content. Two recent projects developed from the model are described, in addition to four previous projects developed by the project team, that exemplify earlier applications of the model. Lessons learned from the project work are identified, and the paper discusses ways in which this type of project work reflects new roles for the professionals participating in the projects, as well as changes in the mission of their organizations and professions."

We should remember that the web was created only in 1990, while the first Internet email message was sent nearly 20 years before, in 1971. Exchanging messages via email, chat, or instant messaging, is the most important activity for the majority of Internet users. Communicating can be very important for a museum too. By using email, you can establish a direct relationship with your public. You collect important feedback from actual and potential visitors. Newsletters can strengthen this relationship. Professionals can be involved in discussion mailing lists about specific themes. Discussion forums and guestbooks can enliven a lot your website. Of course this is not for free; you have to dedicate much time to this activity. At the Science Museum of Milan we have used many of these communication tools: email, newsletters, forums, chat events, guestbooks, discussion mailing lists, online surveys, etc. Our aim was to create a sort of virtual community with our visitors.

Donald Goodes shares your fascination, and is interested in having you participate in the collective consideration of a methodology he is developing specifically for the design of cultural Web sites. Goodes' Cultural Design Methodology (CDM) was initially inspired by more technically-oriented methodologies, such as Relationship Management Methodology (RMM), used in the development of hypermedia applications. From these, CDM borrowed objectives concerning the optimization of process and the definition of a series of well-delineated steps. But CDM adds a parallel goal: the maximization of creative and conceptual input at all stages of development. Goodes will explain the present iteration of CDM, and, in hopes of evolving it further, will open up an exchange inviting participants to share ideas and experiences concerning methodology. Questions that may arise include: When does navigation design end and page design begin? How and when do user relations enter into the design process? What are the benchmarks signaling the completion of a processes? How does one translate the values of the cultural world into methodology? How do parallel processes communicate?"

    "abstract": "As Walter Benjamin described in his famous essay, \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\", the role of art in society and the notion that art has become modified through mechanical reproduction has engaged not only artists, but also curators and the museum public. Benjamin embraced the severing of the quasi-mystical 'aura' from the original as a potentially liberating phenomenon, both for the reproduction of works of art and for the art of film, thereby making works of art widely available, introducing new forms of perception in film and photography and allowing art to move from private to public, from the elite to the masses. While the loss of the aura for Benjamin represented new possibilities, what was forfeited in this process were the 'aura' and the authority of the object containing within it the values of cultural heritage and tradition. This paper evaluates the different ways that museums are responding to life on the Net, and will look to three models of museum Web-sites: the documentation of traditional collections through online databases, the virtual museum with no concrete counterpart to resonate the online experience and the proliferation of Web based contemporary art. This attempt to map out the different ways that museums formulate their identity on the Net will address the notion of the lost aura or perhaps the emergence of new cultural phenomena, the virtual aura."

A Web site offered the possibility to reach a much wider and more diverse audience, with the potential to develop features specifically for students and teachers. NEA reviewers agreed and funded the proposal, but at a fraction of the amount requested. A fortuitous meeting with faculty from the University of Houston College of Education Instructional Technology Program led to a collaboration that has not only made up for the lost funding, but has also given graduate students valuable hands-on experience. This paper addresses lessons learned from the project that will be used not only to improve the Bayou Bend site but also to guide the development of future museum-university collaborations.Keywords: Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, University of Houston, Decorative Arts, Web Site, NEA, Partnership, Course, Students, Bayou Bend."

These addresses were displayed on P.S.1's website, where each artist had his/her own Web-page, and on sheets available in the museum lobby; and most importantly, the addresses were printed directly on to the wall labels in the galleries. This established a platform where public and artist could discuss the work and exchange ideas. The forum was easy, free, international, immediate, private, and almost intimate.

At least 21 of the 60 models were imported from Germany. Maker label stickers show two German makers: nineteen (19) models made by a company called Gustav Voigt and two (2) models by Peter Koch. Students in the days of Japanese industrialization must have been impressed by these sophisticated mechanism models, contrary to a recent Japanese trend that fewer and fewer young people have interests in technology. The 60 models cover a typical set of mechanisms and are still useful today. These include Bevel Gear, Slider Crank, Slotted Crank, Multiple Trammel Gear, Eve's Pump, Fabry's Ventilator, etc. Some models still function but others are out-of-order due to worn-out and/or missing parts. This paper reports on the regeneration of the motions of these mechanism using 3D computer graphic animations created by a mechanical system simulation software called ADAMS, mounts relevant GIF animation files on the Kyoto University Museum web site, thus assisting Japanese children to develop interests in technology through access to a museum of virtual animations."

In an analysis of these and other projects through the lens of Experiential Learning Theory, various approaches to both the experience and the learning environment are demonstrated. Included in this analysis and important to the work created at the Walker Art Center, is the online work of various artists. As solutions are sought to the various problems of presenting conceptual relationships online, how does it effect things to have artists running around nearby, working in the same medium that you are, making archives with attitude, para-site systems that question and track visitors, conceptual portals that direct you places you didn't expect, and asking your opinion of such statements as \"the curator as conceptual artist, the exhibition as performance, the museum as web design, the web as readymade.\" Through the lens of the ideas of experiential learning, we can see connections and interplay between art, interface and the creation of learning environments."

Other projects aim at solving the problem of harmonizing information retrieval of data by using metadata based on the peculiarity of the material in question (e.g. MALVINE). The utilization of authority file information (AFI) in the above mentioned activities is lacking. It is widely accepted that the national and international sharing of AFI is a suitable means for reducing the costs of cataloguing work in libraries, archives and museums as well as the costs for biographical research work undertaken in scientific projects. At the same time the importance of allowing the preservation of national, local or rule-based differences in AFI is generally appreciated (cf. e.g. Report of the IFLA UBCIM Working Group on Minimal Level Authority Records and ISADN). Some issues to be discussed: What exactly is authority file information? Problems of national usage Problems of international usage Problems of quantity Problems of interoperability Consequences of the above. Developing new concepts creation of a model architecture for a distributed search system harvesting existing AFI. implementation of the model architecture in a specific application of cultural heritage data (MALVINE) automatic creation of a highly relevant common (European) name authority file by the execution of a user query. Future possibilities transferal of the model to specific applications within one type of institution (e.g. museum) utilization of the model in a cross domain context of cultural heritage data (e.g. common access to data from libraries, archives and museums implications of the creation and availability of \\\"highly relevant\\\" sections of AFI: obligations involved benefits for big players for small players Learning Objectives It is hoped that the workshop participants will gain a deeper understanding of the benefits of using and sharing authority file information both within and beyond the area of museums.

    "abstract": "Officially titled \"Human Embryology Digital Library and Collaboratory Support Tools,\" this project is part of the Next Generation Internet Initiative and is funded by the National Library of Medicine, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The project's purpose is to demonstrate how leading-edge information technologies in computation, visualization, collaboration, and networking can expand capabilities in science and medicine for developmental studies, clinical work and teaching. It also shows how old collections are being made useful with modern technology. Data for the project comes from the Carnegie Human Embryology Collection at the National Museum of Health and Medicine of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, DC. The project will draw from carefully prepared serially-sectioned specimens acquired between the 1890s and the 1930s. While the project primary focus is on providing a capability for medical professionals and biological scientists to communicate detailed information about development of the human embryo in a visual form, it also contains a component for K-12 and the general public to access and view the HDAC collections. For researchers, the project technical team will develop a network of medical collaboration workstations, using high-performance off-the-shelf networked computer systems combined with advanced software for collaboration and medical visualization. The workstations will be installed at eight project locations and interconnected over high performance networks. As a result, physicians and others will be able to visualize and manipulate high-resolution image data collaboratively for diagnoses, clinical case management, and medical education. For the general public an interface using standard Internet technologies will be provided to view lower resolution sets of image data, access educational information, lab tools and animations. The project plans to demonstrate the network of collaborative visualization workstations in three advanced applications: The Annotation and Modeling application will create an archive of tagged image data for visualization, where every picture element can be associated with any number of different labels, for example the organ system to which it belongs, the structure and tissue types represented, the specimen to which it belongs, etc. This will provide the basic archive that the other two applications will use. The Embryology Education application will make the visualization tools available for medical student use, and also will create animations of embryo organ system development. Heart, lungs and perineal region will be modeled. The Clinical Management Planning application will make the data available in visual form so that a geographically distributed group of physicians can look at it simultaneously, manipulate it, and discuss it."

    "year": "2001",
    "abstract": "Predicting the structure and function of a public system without user input is fraught with danger, but this user input is very difficult to obtain without a working prototype. Traditional system design methods make little provision for evaluation and testing by public users. Weaving the results of evaluation and testing into the end of the system development process presents risks: how, for example, can we address unforeseen navigation problems identified during user evaluation, while at the same time ensuring that tight deadlines are met? Another challenge is that we often work with teams of specialists (interface designers, HTML developers, database specialists, content creators etc): alteration of one element often has knock-on effects on other team members. Drawing on experience with the COMPASS project at the British Museum, the author will present practical ideas for incorporating evaluation into the system development process."

    "abstract": "Museums have always been, sometimes directly and often indirectly, a key resource of arts and cultural heritage information for the classroom educator. The Web now offers an ideal way of taking this resource beyond the traditional textbook or school visit. While museums around the globe are embracing the web and putting virtual exhibitions, cultural databases and archives on-line, the educator (or user in general) is still facing the daunting task of integrating this material into an active document, course, curriculum or presentation. This paper reports on the construction of a personalized theme creation engine as a possible catalyst to the active use in secondary education in Europe of digital media published on-line by selected museums. The HyperMuseum Theme Generator System (TGS) is part of the HyperMuseum system, a European virtual museum portal (Fig. 1). Its function is to assist in the creation of so-called personalized themes. A personalized theme intends to allow the end user to bring together a unique collection of multimedia objects from the HyperMuseum Server, and to create a personalized rendering of the perceived and/or recorded relationships between these objects, realized as a new multimedia document (website, PowerPoint® presentation, hypertext or Word® document etc.). The TGS supports this creative expression both during the discovery phase, exploring the collection and discovering thematic relationships, as well as the realization phase, the construction of the resulting documents. The primary target audience is non-expert users mainly from the secondary education community. This work is partly supported by the Telematics Program (4th Framework) of the European Commission under Project nr. 3088 (HyperMuseum)."

    "abstract": "Focusing on the development of the Walker Art Center online calendar as a case study, this presentation looks at the some of the strategies, methods and assets used in publishing an online, institutional calendar that provides a rich resource both for institutions and their audiences. First launched in December 1998, the Walker online calendar neatly delivers information, images and audio and video clips on the approximately sixty events and exhibitions, the Walker offers each month. Beginning with the source materials (from press kits and releases to printed matter, slides and videotapes), we'll look at the various resources for content and techniques for obtaining and repurposing this content for use in an online calendar, including how to develop intradepartmental cooperation and establish digitization standards. Continuing with process, we'll look at the nitty-gritty details of how a typical Walker calendar is produced in any given month, including a breakdown of technical and human resources, timing, responsibilities, and manpower-who is doing what and when, and how long it takes. Then, with an eye to the navigation and design of the Walker's Calendar, we'll consider some of the choices the Walker has made along with their incumbent advantages and disadvantages, including whether or not to implement a database-driven calendar, what kind of event highlighting options make sense, how does the calendar reflect the greater institution, and how does the calendar connect with other content areas of the site (i.e. programming areas, eCommerce, event ticketing, etc.). Finally, we'll explore some proposed renovations and refinements to the Walker calendar and look briefly at highlights of a few calendars delivered by other institutions."

    "abstract": "With the introduction of the digital medium, an abundance of content previously obtainable through other media became available in digital form. Digital delivery implied the necessity for some kind of content modification dictated by the specific characteristics of the digital medium. The situation is further complicated by the convergence of different media used for the delivery of digital/digitized information. The same content has to meet the constraints of different display devices and bandwidth limitations. Furthermore, digital delivery makes possible adaptations of content not only in regard to characteristics of hardware used to display it, but also in regard to individual user's goals and needs. In this paper I will present the implications for content re-purposing with the migration from the traditional to the digital medium as well as the problems that arise from convergence of different types of digital delivery mechanism."

    "abstract": "The Four Directions Project, funded by the U. S. Department of Education, is an education project with the goal of using technology to support culturally responsible education for Native American Students. One culturally responsive teaching strategy is virtual museum projects done in partnership with museums that hold important cultural items. The paper describes the learning project that led to in the creation of the Virtual Tour of the National Museum of the American Indian. Emerging from this experience is a Four Directions model for school-museum partnerships for virtual museum projects. The model considers such projects in the context of three overlapping concepts: culturally responsive education, cultural revitalization, and cultural collaboration. The model is illustrated through a description of virtual museum project activities from both the educator and museum professional perspective and through an account of the development of American Indian education and contemporary museums."

    "abstract": "INA, the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel keeps records of national TV and radio production as French patrimonial archives. They are mainly accessed by specialists for research purposes, and by TV producers for inserting archive segments within new productions. INA and several others partners have initiated an R&D project, OPALES, to develop a distributed environment which enhances experts private work on multimedia archives and enables collaborative knowledge work on the Web. The challenge is to advance knowledge by building digital communities of experts who add value to the archival dataset by annotating items. The environment supports users working on multimedia archives, preserves their data in private workspaces, and helps them to share expertise. Each end-user accesses information within a private workspace. Any document (annotation as well as archive) is handled as a private copy which can virtually be annotated, indexed, linked to other information, edited to be inserted into new documents, and so on. Direct anchoring of annotations within audio or video is supported. To manage information and knowledge sharing, OPALES introduces the notions of an authoring point of view which identifies annotation categories and of a reading point of view which specifies which categories of annotations a reader wants to see. Any added piece of information always has an author and an authoring point of view. To enable knowledge sharing, any user can export a point of view to make some part of the elaborated knowledge available to others. Exporting a point of view consists of indexing it into the shared ontology to enable other experts to retrieve it easily and import it into their workspaces. A reading point of view defines how a document is enhanced by annotations when presented. It is a mix of imported points of view. For instance, a researcher on sociology may import (borrow) the knowledge previously elicited and exported by economists, politicians, ethnologists, and so on, to better understand a document or to improve the relevance of queries. The selected annotations and links are displayed with the document. To enable computer activity using shared information, the system provides a mechanism for handling an extensible ontology, including point of view dependant aspects. It provides support for indexing and for searching in annotated documents. The paper presents the features of OPALES, describes the mixing of points of view on video archives, and discusses some issues raised by knowledge sharing among experts."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the creation of a knowledge base that provides educational support for museum exhibitions in the hypermedia environment. The subject of this report is \\\"Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality,\\\" a project commissioned by Artmuseum.net and created by multimedia artist and historian Randall Packer. The site explores the broad historical trajectory in the arts and sciences that has converged as multimedia, providing a critical foundation of media history, aesthetic inquiry, and social critique that enriches the viewer\\'s visit to Artmuseum.net. \\\"Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality\\\" embraces the dynamics of multimedia in its study of the medium, providing the on-line visitor with a better understanding of the language of media, the complexity of non-sequential learning and exploration, and new ways of thinking about essential concepts of media such as interactivity, immersion, hypermedia, integration and narrativity. The site\\'s contents, which include a timeline of multimedia\\'s pioneers, an illustrated historical narrative of multimedia, and in-depth studies of the creative work of seminal artists and scientists, serves as a knowledge base that provides historical and theoretical context for several of Artmuseum.net\\'s exhibitions that showcase media art. A section devoted to using the site in the classroom, from which teachers can derive presentations, enrich on-line syllabi with links, and give students research assignments, becomes a model and educational tool for both students and teachers - guiding them in the use of Artmuseum.net and how it extends itself into the classroom. The paper will include a detailed explanation of the specific educational objectives of the site, its integration with Artmuseum.net exhibitions, and how it is being prototyped in digital arts curriculum, notably Randall Packer\\'s courses at the Maryland Institute, College of Art in Baltimore. This project is part of a larger hybrid-publishing project, which includes the book of the same name, co-edited by Randall Packer and Ken Jordan and published by W.W. Norton for April 2001."

    "abstract": "Cooperation Metaphors are sets of rules to support interaction and collaboration between users who want to explore complex content and information together. The rules determine how the collaborative community can be created and managed, how members of the community can operate on their own or can cooperate with other members. Different types of situations, tasks and user roles determine different behaviours and therefore need different metaphors. The paper will present the general issue, describing in general what cooperation metaphors are and how they can be defined. A number of examples, related to typical activities for virtual museums (i.e. museums on the Web) will be used in order to give a practical understanding of what cooperation is, or can be. The paper will also argue that virtual metaphors lack some of the features of real-life cooperation, but, on the other hand, can also offer unexpected, powerful and effective possibilities not available in (traditional) real-life. Finally, the paper will describe how collaborative activities for virtual museums can be implemented using today's tools and applications for collaboration on the Web; such as Net2gether, Microsoft Research's Virtual Worlds, and the WebTalk series."

    "abstract": "Using the same data, which could come from local databases or external sources such as the Web, virtual museum designers can build different hyperspaces. It is possible that visitors would find some of them more useful than others. Therefore, virtual museums designers should be equipped with a tool by which various hyperspaces for virtual museums can be easily designed and examined. In this paper, we view a virtual museum as a hypertext that consists of nodes and links and show that a database publishing tool called Lazy, which generates a hypertext view (i.e., derived hypertext) of a given database, can be used for designing virtual museums. The Lazy system consists of a declarative hypertext view specification language, a node schema compiler, and a node server that processes node requests. Since the language is purely declarative, it is fairly easy to construct and revise hyperspaces for a virtual museum. With this tool it becomes possible to adopt an iterative design methodology. Given a database for a virtual museum, we first construct a hypertext using the procedure (Falquet & al., 1999) called an initial structure. We then proceed to analyze the initial structure and examine possible refinement operations that can enhance the usability of the created hypertext. For that purpose, we use a simple graph-based analysis and we show kinds of analysis that can be done using the graph-based approach. Once the structure is refined using the refinement operations, we apply grammar-based formalism (Park, 1998) to the refined structure to see whether we can obtain a simpler grammar that can generate the same hyperspace. Our goal is to explore various analysis techniques on the hypertext and give insights into designing a good hyperspace using the analysis results."

    "abstract": "The Science Museum, London has recently opened the “Welcome Wing,” a new extension devoted to contemporary science and technology. A major part of the new wing is a museum developed system called “Save” which allows visitors to create their own web site as a souvenir of their visit. Many exhibits across the Welcome Wing allow visitors to create something - morph their face, take a picture of their iris or analyze their voice. Save is an exhibit independent system linking these exhibits. It enables visitors to save their creations onto their own souvenir web site. Rather than having to go through a long log-in process every time they want to save an item, the system identifies visitors using their fingerprint. Part of the system is an exhibit that enables visitors to re-design their site in a graphic style of their choice. At a visitor level Save allows the automatic generation of a personalized web site that acts as a souvenir of their visit. This provides a powerful message about the use of internet and biometric technology to provide a personalized experience. At an institutional level, Save is a continuation of our desire to explore the way in which the museum communicates with its audience. It provides a new framework by which we can engage our audience in the ongoing debate about science and technology."

Much of this rich content is unavailable to web search engines or otherwise gets lost in the vastness of the World Wide Web. The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) has developed an easily implemented protocol to enable data providers to expose their information and service providers to access and use it. The CIMI Consortium is working with the OAI to make it possible for museums to enhance the availability of their research resources, allowing them to be discovered in Web-space by the specialist audiences for which they are intended or by service providers who collect, distribute or in other ways provide access. By building on the OAI protocol, Dublin Core, and museum community XML developments, significant advancements can be made in exposing museum information resources. This paper introduces the OAI and its protocol, explores its potential relevance to museums, presents CIMI's work as an alpha tester of OAI, and looks ahead to future developments."

    "year": "2001",
    "abstract": "This paper summarizes a 10-month long research project conducted at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center aimed at developing the design concept of a multi-institutional art and culture web site. The work followed a user-centered design (UCD) approach, where interaction with prototypes and feedback from potential users of the web site were sought throughout all the phases of the design process. In the first phase of the research, we conducted interviews with museum curators, issued questionnaires to brick and mortar museum visitors, performed on-line surveys with users of museum web sites, ran focus groups, and performed usability walk-throughs of best-of-breed museum web sites and of our new web site design ideas. The results showed a surprisingly strong interest in streaming multimedia, TV-like experiences where users watched experts and artists talk about art and culture, augmented by links to additional and in-depth information. Such a design strategy was clearly favored by our subjects over more interactive experiences such as chat rooms, information search systems, or user-curated tours. In other words, when users go to a web site of arts and culture looking for entertaining and educational content, they seem to be less interested in clicking to find information than in watching people, especially experts and celebrities, present and discuss artistic works from their perspective. Based on the results of the first phase, we developed a prototype of a web site based on the concept of \"tours\" --- 5-10 minute streaming multimedia experiences led by experts and artists, accessible by users with normal telephone connections (56Kbps modems). The tours resemble a slide show enhanced by narration, music, occasional video clips, and hot spots for extra information. Two pilot tours were fully produced and tested with users who reported great satisfaction with the tours in terms of their entertainment, engagement, and educational values. We also observed that the most satisfied users were those who interacted and explored the least during a tour. The research described in this paper suggests that people interested in art and culture have an affinity for web sites where they can have entertaining, curated experiences in many ways similar to short TV-like documentaries. Yet there are many other occasions when they are looking for engaging educational and entertaining experiences. In such situations, less interactive but narratively structured streaming experiences with a human voice seem to be a very appealing format to engage and satisfy such users. Importantly, they do not see such experiences as a substitute for actual visits to museums or attendance at live performances, but as an enriching and highly accessible way to augment the cultural experiences and performances they enjoy in brick and mortar cultural institutions around the world. People are often looking for specific information about artists and art works."

    "abstract": "This presentation focuses on the strategic design planning and vision creation process for the E-Quarium, the online complement to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. More than six months of informed investigation and analysis resulted in an ambitious redesign of the web site, which launched in October 1999. The aquarium and AlbenFaris worked in close partnership in a collaborative development process that included visitor research, establishment of a clear strategic vision, a set of goals and content objectives, identification of target audiences, scenario planning, competitive analysis, site definition and design. As a result, the new E-Quarium exemplifies the relevance of grounded design practice. More than a design case study, this is a thoughtful weaving of the process, perspectives and experiences the designers gained from understanding the aquarium's structure, mission and culture and the needs of the aquarium's key audiences. The inclusion of experts in marine biology and conservation, exhibition design and technology as members of the development team provided inspiration and insights beyond the normal boundaries of interactive design. This presentation is also a journey into the wonder of kelp forests and the deep sea-habitats showcased in the aquarium exhibits and the online E-Quarium. Both the physical aquarium and the E-Quarium have a profound effect on visitors, inspiring and informing them about the wonders of the oceans. And both serve as catalysts, making visitors aware of ocean conservation issues and encouraging them to join with the Monterey Bay Aquarium in the cause of ocean conservation."

    "abstract": "Access to cultural exhibits is a central issue in museums and exhibition galleries that is recently approached under a new, technological perspective. Although the cultural industries' practices in the cases of museums and cultural exhibits have remained practically unchanged for long, in recent years we are witnessing a gradual adoption of media-technologies in various aspects, such as collections archiving and digital document preservation, media- and Web-presentation, graphical animations, etc. The advent of such technologies contributes towards providing media-rich presentations of cultural exhibits and consequently offering better services to museum visitors. Lately, Internet and Web-based technologies have been employed for providing access, mostly to images of exhibited objects. With current technology such access is limited due to the non-interactive nature of pre-recorded images or videos and the difficulty in constant updating of the sites when there is change in the content. In few cases, the incorporation of higher-end technology, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, or robotics, is explored. Some science museums, large \\\"edu-tainment\\\" venues, and recreation parks have traditionally been the ones to embrace new media first, by employing fascinating and sophisticated interactive installations and presenting up-to-date results on the creative use of technology. In this paper we present such an effort, the TOURBOT project, which emphasizes the development of alternative ways for interactive museum tele-presence, essentially through the use of robotic \\\"avatars\\\". TOURBOT, an acronym for TOUr-guide RoBOT, represents a collaboration between museums, technology providers, and brokers of technology to museums. The overall goal of TOURBOT is the development of an interactive tour-guide robot able to provide individual access to museums\\' exhibits and cultural heritage over the Internet. TOURBOT operates as the user\\'s surrogate personna (avatar) in the museum by accepting commands over the web that direct it to move in its physical workspace and visit specific exhibits. In other words, the imaged scene of the museum and the exhibits is communicated over the Internet to the remote visitor. As a result the user enjoys a personalized tele-presence to the museum, being able to choose the exhibits to visit, as well as the preferred viewing conditions (point of view, distance to the exhibit, resolution, etc). In addition to remote interaction with the robot, TOURBOT can also act as a flexible, on-site museum guide to visitors that are physically present. By interacting with the tour-guide robot, museum visitors have the ability to individually exploit the expertise stored in the robot, which can react flexibly to their requirements. It can, for example, offer dedicated tours of specific focus to exhibitions or alternatively give overview tours. As a side effect of this concept, museum visitors get acquainted with new, cutting-edge technology by easily interacting with a complex robotic system. Therefore, technological advances are seamlessly assimilated in everyday activities. This approach to cultural heritage access presents a high degree of novelty as well as a number of technical and conceptual issues and challenges. This paper discusses these issues while analyzing the expected benefits and expectations from visitors, the community, and the museums."

Conducted by Westside Community Schools in Omaha, Nebraska, eight Nebraska school districts and five art museums participate in this curriculum development. Via the Internet, educators both nationally and internationally are able to access these resources and interact with other teachers and students. These resources have included virtual exhibitions with on-line curricula and interpretive materials, e-school sessions, teacher chat rooms, interactive activities using on-line images, a list-serve, and more. Administrators and teachers from participating school districts receive on-going training so that they may best utilize the Project's resources. Museum partners visit the school districts and are assisted by teachers in developing in-house and on-line curricula that are easily adapted into both the classroom and museum galleries. Museum partners include the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC; the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska; the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden in Lincoln, Nebraska; the Museum of Nebraska Art in Kearney, Nebraska; and the National Museum of Wildlife Art in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; all of whom provide a rich resource for educators to incorporate into their curricula."

    "abstract": "The paper presents a research project conducted by the Department of Information Science in cooperation with the Saarland Museum, the art museum of the Federal State of Saarland, Germany. The study had two aims. The first was to evaluate some methods of usability engineering for the Web, and the second was to evaluate the usability of the Saarland Museum's Web site and improve it. The applied usability engineering methods were an expert-judgment-focused evaluation using heuristic evaluation with the Heuristics for Web Communication and a user-focused evaluation conducting a laboratory test with actual users and the thinking-aloud method. The combination of heuristic evaluation and laboratory testing provided interesting results. The heuristic evaluation detected a vast number of usability problems. The laboratory test confirmed most of these findings as usability problems and added some usability problems that experts did not discover because actual users often have a different perspective. The evaluation led to a re-design of the Web site."

    "abstract": "This paper will examine recent initiatives to create original \"mini-sites\" of information and resources for use in K-12 classrooms. These \"galleries of information\" include cross-institutional collaborations with various arts and humanities organizations across the world. In particular, the paper will focus on an interactive site based on the life and music of Duke Ellington as well as on a mini-site celebrating the arts of Ireland through a \"virtual museum\" based on art works from private and public collections in the United States and Ireland. These online exhibits and sites were created specifically for educational use and embody certain aspects and attributes worth sharing with the broader arts community. Highlights will include: designing for a diverse audience with various technological capabilities; gathering and re-presenting original materials; and creating arts-integrated lesson plans and activities for young online audiences."

    "abstract": "Streaming audio and video present new challenges and opportunities for museums. Streaming media is easier to author and deliver to Internet audiences than ever before; digital video editing is commonplace now that the tools -- computers, digital video cameras, and hard drives -- are so affordable; the cost of serving video files across the Internet has also significantly decreased. The initial growth of the World Wide Web was driven by the ease of authoring Web pages, the affordability of the medium, and the potential to reach large audiences. The same conditions are now in place for streaming audio and video, and were just beginning to see the widespread use of the technology. The challenges and opportunities presented to museums today are similar to those that existed when the World Wide Web first became popular. Many questions raised are the same: Can this technology be used to expand the museum experience? Are there ways to take advantage of the \"two-way\" nature of the Internet? A few museums have already experimented with streaming media and some lessons have been learned. However, presentation methods and the technology itself continue to evolve. This paper shares experiences with streaming media (focusing on streaming video), and discusses some possible new directions for effective use of the medium within online museum environments."

    "abstract": "The Cleveland Museum of Art has embarked on an innovative approach for delivering high quality video-on-demand and live interactive cultural programming, along with Web-based complementary material, to seniors in assisted living residence facilities, community-based centers, and disabled persons in their homes. The project is made possible in part by a grant from the Technology Opportunity Program [TOP], National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce totaling more than $500,000. The purpose of the grant is to demonstrate how emerging broadband telecommunications technology can deliver \"lifelong learning and the arts\" to populations for whom direct involvement with cultural institutions would otherwise not be possible. The approach uses Cisco IP/TV interactive video archive/broadcast servers and broadband multicast technology in a controlled public infrastructure environment, rather than the closed corporate or campus network environment for which it was designed. In addition to describing the program design and operation, this paper analyzes how this Museum, whose core competency is not, nor should be, advanced technology development and management, mustered the expertise to achieve technological innovation in pursuit of programmatic goals. It also focuses on the process of convening outside individuals, organizations, and expertise to complement each other to achieve a common goal."

    "abstract": "\"An effective educational museum might be described as a collection of labels bearing instructions, each of them illustrated by a carefully selected specimen.\" George Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary at the Smithsonian, 1896 (Alexander, 1979). Although Goode's assertion may look naive by contemporary pedagogical and museological standards, Im sure many of us wish that the process of museum education were indeed that easy. However, we know that such assertions are anathema, as both the primacy of the object and our understanding of learning have advanced considerably in the last 100 years. Since the arrival of photography in the mid nineteenth century, the interpretive pre-eminence of artefacts has been steadily eroded by a succession of media. More recently, interactive multimedia (IMM) have penetrated homes as well as museums, transforming visitor expectations as well as the way modern museums approach education. The most ubiquitous of contemporary IMM, the Internet, is making steady progress as an interpretive tool within museums. However, its major impact is being felt beyond museum walls. As an outreach agent, the Internet has captivated many museums and particularly their educators. As a communication medium, the Internet allows museum educators to enter the homes and schools of students without their ever needing to visit the museum. So it's not surprising that some museum education products try to simulate the spatial and social experience of visiting a museum. However, this approach is just one of many resource \"types\" educators have deployed as they grapple with the promise and reality of on-line education. As part of the research team developing Australian Museums On Line's new Education Gateway, I have spent considerable time examining why and how museums are using the Internet for education outreach. In this paper I will explore these, as well as the diversity of emerging on-line education expressions. I will also review current research into the unique interface, navigation and content preferences of various learners and, just as important, discuss best practice teaching and learning strategies to help museum educators develop more effective on-line educational resources.

    "year": "2001",
    "abstract": "An empirical study conducted at the Toledo (Ohio) Museum of Art examined the responses of 86 non-expert museum visitors to pictures presented in five formats-oil on canvas paintings, printed pages from books, black-and-white glossy photos, color slides, and digital images. Test subjects responded to the same 20 pictures presented in different formats and different showing orders, identifying the expressional content depicted in the images and answering questions designed to test perceptions about the ability of surrogates to reproduce the expressional power of an original oil painting. This paper reports preliminary findings from the Toledo Picture Study. Test data show that statistically significant differences exist with regard to the intensity of the emotions test subjects feel, the ease with which they identify feelings and emotions in the various formats, and the relative ability of an original work of art to convey feeling or emotion. These findings thus reaffirm the informational imperative of access to museum collections in their original form. Qualitative responses, in particular those that mention the effect of the gallery's parquet floors and deeply-hued walls, the presence of others in the gallery, or those individuals who shared stories of past experiences at the museum as children, with their families, or as volunteers, all point to exciting new directions for future investigation. Future studies might be well served to look at the gallery itself and it's effect on the way individuals respond to the physical object."

    "abstract": "Just marketing a museum isn't good enough any more. With increased competition among museums as culture destinations, each must distinguish itself from the others. That's branding, and all good marketers are doing it. Using the Web only for virtual visits and information is under-utilizing it. The Web is, in fact, a powerful branding tool. For young people especially, the spontaneity and flash of the Web not only sells museums in general, but brands individual museums specifically. Effective Web sites, like all marketing media, utilize consistent images and copy to communicate their brand. Logo, theme line, type face, layout format, design motifs, color, icons, and tone of voice are among the features that must be deployed throughout the Web site to make it coherent, easy to navigate, and fun for young people. The artwork featured on the opening pages helps portray the museum's brand image, and could determine how long, if at all, a young visitor stops at the site. Appropriateness of the museum store items offered online affects whether young people will literally buy the museum's image and add their names to its database. The brand image must continue through sticky features such as the calendar, promotions, and links so those youthful surfers make the connection between Web site and actual museum, and start the conversion to repeat visitor, advocate, and member. This study, to be conducted in October-November, 2000, examines college students' reactions to a range of art museum Web sites and the brand images they reflect. A different random sample of ten art museum Web sites were given to each of fifty college students. Students were asked to navigate the ten sites and select two that communicate a meaningful brand identity based on a checklist of features such as Web site architecture, copy, design, typography, color, audio, logo, and other iconography. The students also participated in small focus groups to further probe the strength of the Web sites' and museums' brand images. It is anticipated that the study will produce examples of effectively branded museum Web sites and a list of Web site branding tools that any museum marketer can adapt."

    "abstract": "Museum, library, archive, and other cultural heritage database collections are growing along with their numbers of users. Traditional methods of image retrieval will be insufficient. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR), a computer technique for retrieving images based on color, texture, and shape, locates visually similar matches for a selected painting, print, drawing, or other objects. The technique will become increasingly useful when combined with traditional methods of accessing images. Collage, the Corporation of London Guildhall Library and Guildhall Art Gallery 22,400 digital image collection, was selected as a test site for the application and evaluation of CBIR. The Institute for Image Data Research (IIDR) at the University of Northumbria at Newcastle and iBase Image Systems, developer of the Collage software, collaborated with the London Guildhall Library to introduce CBIR technology for image retrieval on the Collage web site. Initial evaluation of the CBIR feature by an online questionnaire indicated the majority of the respondents thought CBIR was useful, results were satisfactory and interesting, it was a good method to retrieve images, and they would like to use it again. Information derived from the results is important for developing and applying software to refine visual search retrieval. This research is supported by a grant from Resource: The Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries (CMAL/RE/103) and is part of an ongoing study, Evaluation of Content-based Image Retrieval in an Operational Setting, conducted at the University of Northumbria at Newcastle, Institute for Image Data Research."

    "abstract": "Interactive Knowledge, an e-learning company, and the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, North Carolina have collaborated successfully on a number of interactive electronic learning projects. The Mint is committed to providing school children as well as the general public with high quality educational programs. Over the past five years the Mint has worked with Interactive Knowledge to create a wide variety of interactive programs, from websites complementing large traveling exhibits to e-learning products for 5th graders. Several new projects are in the pipeline including a large-scale interactive website titled \"The Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame.\" The latest collaboration is a comprehensive look at North Carolina history. Crafting North Carolina is an e-learning program that features a unique approach to teaching history by linking the state's progress since pre-colonial time to the art and craft produced by North Carolinians. Crafting North Carolina is designed for fourth graders but will be an integral part of the Mint's main website since the content is appropriate for the general public. Crafting North Carolina is a web-based, interactive exploration of North Carolina's rich craft tradition. In 4th grade North Carolina students are studying the state's history and culture. Crafting North Carolina mixes information about North Carolina's craft tradition with content from the 4th grade social studies curriculum. The program will utilize images of art and crafts created by North Carolinians from The Mint Museum of Art's collection. All of this will add up to a web site that is an interactive and engaging experience. The goal of this project is to help students gain an appreciation of the state's craft tradition and reinforce material taught in the classroom. The Crafting North Carolina web site will have a section for teachers and for students. The teacher section will give information about what's in the site and how to use it. The student section will have web-based educational activities and printable student activity sheets. The web-based activities include: Early Glimpses of North Carolina -- An exploration of the state's earliest days, including Native Americans, explorers and mapmakers. 200 Years of Clay -- An exploration of one of North Carolina's oldest traditions, including Colonial potters, potters around the Civil War era, pottery in the machine age, and pottery as art From the Land -- An exploration of North Carolina's natural resources and how artists use them in their work. What the Use? -- An exploration of the utilitarian nature of pottery. Clay Techniques -- Young Travis Owen, a fifth generation North Carolina potter from Seagrove leads us in the basics of throwing and firing a pot. Virtual Fieldtrips -- Get on the bus and visit artists and craft sites across the state, including Sid Luck's pottery studio, Cynthia Bringle's pottery studio, Stony Lamar's wood turning workshop, Billie Ruth Suddeth's basket-weaving studio, and a student led trip through the Mint Museum of Craft + Design. In this presentation Chuck Barger, Vice-President of Interactive Design will demonstrate Crafting North Carolina and describe the process, team approach and production techniques for creating large scale e-learning programs for museums."

    "abstract": "Museums are investing more and more time and effort into the creation of web resources. These resources are aimed at educating and entertaining each museum's audience, ranging from school children to adults, teachers, and parents. However, very little research exists into how these resources are actually being used, and who is using them. This paper will look at the intent, design, and results of a pilot effort to gather just such information about the use and effectiveness of a set of science education web resources. As part of the international Science Learning Network, a collaborative group of science centers, The Exploratorium and the Science Museum of London undertook to track and detail the use of two of our existing science resources: The Science of Cycling: Flights of Inspiration: http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/flights/index.html These resources were chosen as both fairly representative, since they are aimed at both general and school audiences, and fairly different in their design and content. Over a three month period in late 1999 and early 2000, we implemented a study to look at how these sites being used, who is using them, and how they are being used on-line (i.e., pathway analysis and questionnaires) and in the classroom (i.e., through classroom observation). We performed both independent analysis of individual resources and some comparative analysis how uses differed between the UK and the US. The study consisted of: collecting and analyzing general numeric use data of SLN resource activity on the two institution's Web sites; periodic detailed log analysis of two specific SLN resources on the two institutions Web sites; the creation and review of online use questionnaires linked with these two specific SLN resources; evaluation interviews with teachers who have used the resources; and in-class observations of resource use. The results of this study will help individual museums to develop better resources and to understand the impact of web resources in schools, homes, and other educational environments. The study has also provided valuable experience with these various evaluation techniques to help other museums conduct their own use evaluations."

    "abstract": "The Digital Cultural Heritage Community project at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is an eighteen-month project, the primary focus of which is the digitization of materials from local area museums, archives and libraries for early and late elementary grades social science curricula. Using curriculum units delivered by the participant teachers and the Illinois Social Science Learning Standards for direction, examples of the types of primary source materials that have already been digitized or would need to be digitized for inclusion in a digital repository are identified by the museum curators and librarians. Content selection is determined through an on-going review process, with the goal of enabling the teachers to integrate digital cultural heritage materials into the curricula. The participants are simultaneously determining the steps necessary to make the content available to teachers and students, and to create the digital repository that will be accessible through the project Web site. In order to create an integrated system usable by each participant institution, several issues are of concern, particularly metadata. Firstly, the metadata must be complex enough to easily integrate the different forms of metadata currently used by each participant museum or library. It must, at the same time, be simple enough to be easily understood by the participant elementary school teachers and their students. Each museum and library must be willing and able to merge its content and metadata with multiple other sources. Issues currently being considered include OCLC's Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC), Dublin Core and EAD, as well as the creation of dynamically delivered HTML and Microsoft Active Server Pages (MS-ASP) using MS-Access or AltaMira Press's PastPerfect as a database source. Other important issues for the museums and libraries include the development of a collaborative agreement to include a set of terms and conditions for digital access to collections, the right to distribute materials, permissions to host materials, and a \"Conditions of Use\" statement for users accessing the collections. At this point in the project, our interactions have yielded several significant discoveries that may be of interest to other similar endeavors. Firstly, each school district had created its own interpretation of the Illinois Learning Standards, necessitating additional review of local standards to insure that the project addressed goals and objectives that were pertinent on a local as well as a state level. Secondly, as teachers made their curriculum units available, it became clear that there might not always be a good fit between curriculum needs and the local area museum and library collections. In order to get over this stumbling block, the curators and librarians must be more innovative when choosing items to digitize. In turn, teachers must be willing and able to make use of materials with their students in more imaginative ways. Finally, we must develop a set of guidelines and standards for the museums and libraries to enable the creation of a consistent database, easily mapping between different controlled vocabularies and organizational data."

Watermarks have been used since centuries to prove the genuineness, authenticity, and authorship of documents or certain products of different crafts. In this tradition digital watermarks are used for copyright protection today. They are bits inserted into a digital image, audio, or video file to identify the file's copyright information. They have to be robust against different kinds of manipulations and attacks. Unfortunately, no watermarking tool on the market produces digital watermarks as robust as needed, experts negate its existence at all. Alternate solutions are needed. An infrastructure with or without watermarking the original has to be established. This paper describes related problems and directions to solve them so that a museum can publish parts of its collection with no harm."

Spacious and state-of-the-art, the specially commissioned building was designed by the award winning British architect, David Chipperfield. The museum was opened in August 1998 and is already an architectural landmark. The museum has won a number of awards including the National Heritage UK Museum of the Year 1999, Building of the Year 1999 for England (shortlisted for the Stirling Prize) and Website of the Week for two weeks running in the 24 Hour Museum UK museums portal. The website has been produced at minimal cost, but is simple and effective in design (matching the minimalist design of the museum building itself) and attracting over 65,000 visitors so far (more than have visited the physical museum). The website is organized in a simple hierarchical manner. The homepage is designed to present the museum in different ways for different categories of user such as general visitors, including the disabled, children, teachers, researchers, group visitors, museum supporters, event organizers, the press, etc. The presentation will give a history of the development of the website, originally initiated in 1995 several years before the museum actually opened. This helped establish the museum's presence throughout the world, particularly to the rowing community. Plans for the future, especially how the website fits into the museum's marketing strategy, will also be covered. Attendees should gain tips on how to produce a cost-effective website that is designed to be user-oriented. URL: http://www.rrm.co.uk/ (museum) http://www.museums.reading.ac.uk/mw2000/paper/ (paper)"

    "abstract": "Visitors to modern museum and library exhibitions see only a limited number of objects selected from the collections. Although exhibitions are designed to interpret those selected objects for a particular audience, exhibition designers and museum administrators have attempted to increase the range of that audience by simplifying descriptive label copy. With limited label copy, it can be difficult for the visitor to understand the chosen object in the context of the scientific, artistic or cultural theory presented in the exhibition. What happens when the visitor wants more? Meanwhile, developments in computer technology present new challenges and opportunities for educators in formal academic settings, libraries and museums. The popular World Wide Web has become an important resource for information seekers, although traditional information providers remain hesitant to distribute their information through this medium. Consequently education suffers because quality information is not being organized, integrated and delivered to an increasing audience of users through the Web. With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon are collaborating to develop, document and disseminate the prototype of a Smart Web Exhibit. Smart Web Exhibits (SWE) are designed to deliver information online, on target and in time to a diverse user community. Like the user selecting material from the library catalog, the museum visitor will select material from the SWE to supplement the museum's exhibits, following suggested trails or striking off on new ones of their own choosing. The SWE extends the museum exhibition, allowing the visitor to see the full text of the selected article or letter or the field photographs or videos, not just the index terms in the catalog. Two SWE will be developed from signature collections in Carnegie Mellon University Archives and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The library SWE will enable users to search photographs, correspondence, lecture notes and published and unpublished papers of two early innovators in computer science: Herbert Simon and Alan Newell. The museum SWE will focus on unpublished correspondence and field notes, published scientific and popular articles and photographs documenting the discovery of dinosaurs in the collection of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The SWE will be available onsite in information kiosks in the museum adjacent to the collections discussed, in the library and across the Web. The SWE has three goals that distinguish it from other online exhibits. First, Web-accessible, high-quality, high-value content will be delivered and preserved over time. Second, the project will generate the organizational model and authoring, indexing and usage analysis tools that add value to content and can be re-used with other multimedia collections. Third, research will be conducted and disseminated in human factors, electronic commerce, digital imaging and the collaboration of museums and libraries in the service of education. This paper will report on the progress made toward these goals. Additional URL: http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmnh."

Often, more subjective features of a site, like color, audience needs and expectations, presentation techniques, and graphics, are disregarded. However, people from different cultures do have different expectations and needs, and meeting these needs improves the usability of localized versions of a multilingual Web site. Museums are of interest to, and visited by, people from all over the world. Likewise, a museum Web site must be accessible and usable across cultures. This research examines general features that make a site more usable. It discusses demographics of Web usage and the impact of culture and background on Web users. The primary research involves a usability study of different culture groups using the Louvre Museum Official Web Site, which is available in four languages. The participants, from France, Ireland, Spain, and Japan, were observed and video-recorded during co-operative evaluation sessions interacting with the site as they attempted to complete tasks. Each group was controlled with respect to age (20 -- 30 years), gender (two male and two female in each group), profession (all students), and familiarity with Web technology. Results show that the site's neutral graphics were popular across all culture groups. Participants from all backgrounds admired pictures of the museum's artifacts, demonstrating the graphic potential of the Web medium, and the ability of art to transcend cultural boundaries. However, not all graphic features were usable. Japanese participants had great difficulty locating a suitable diagram of the museum. In addition, labels and captions on diagrams were not localized. Results also illustrate that the usability of a multilingual Web space depends to a great extent on flexibility. Users need alternative ways to access information and navigate a site, depending on their individual and cultural needs. However, the Louvre site provides inadequate navigation support. For example, all participants relied heavily on the browser's Back button to navigate the site. Only French participants used the navigation bar at the top of each page to return to the main menu. The site is best suited to French audiences, 100% of whom expressed overall satisfaction. Japanese participants were least satisfied with the site; two of the four considered the experience frustrating. This frustration stems from the fact that the Japanese version is incomplete, and users must access many parts of the site using other language versions. Japanese users wanted to access all parts of the site in their own language. They would not have used other parts of the site in normal circumstances, even though 75% liked the Collections part of the site (not available through Japanese) best. Essentially, and despite some significant usability issues, it is clear that young people, and people with no background in art are interested in this kind of site. Only one (Japanese) participant said he would not use the site again."

    "abstract": "Sound--one of the most underutilized creative web design tools--can differentiate your site, aid in the presentation and navigation of information, and work with other design elements to create new experiences online. Audio offers another means of exploring and understanding the complex world we live in. Current research in the relatively new field of \"sonification,\" in fact, examines ways in which sound can be used as another means of \"visualization.\" Meanwhile, at a more pragmatic level, the current revolution in how music is being marketed and delivered online means that the audio design tools are out there (and waiting to be used). Popular browser programs now feature sophisticated built-in sound support and plug-ins such as RealPlayer and Shockwave deliver high quality web sound. Bandwidth constraints are increasingly less relevant as high speed and cable modems allow faster web access. This workshop is NOT about the \"how to\"-it's about the \"why\" of audio enhancement. It's not about Flash or MIDI versus streaming audio, or which plug-ins and players are cool. It's about why you would want to even bother with audio on a web page in the first place. What does audio have to offer the web community? Can it open new channels for learning--or make information accessible in a new way? In what ways are museums already using it--and how might it be used to even greater effect? You'll learn more about the current state of technology (with appropriate references to the \"how-to\"), see some sites that offer interesting new uses of audio, and have a chance to share your thoughts on creatively using sound as content."

    "abstract": "At the turn of the twenty-first century, the first stage of museum digitization is now well underway. Many museums have initiated and made headway on projects to put their holdings on-line, package their collections management databases into Web sites, and produce curatorial content for a worldwide, on-line audience. As institutions move into the second phase of these developments, which emerging technologies show the most promise for museums and their audiences? Which principles should form the core of a museum's digitization strategy over the long term? How will improved access to museum collections affect research possibilities for a broad range of people, both in academia and among the general public? Working together since 1997 to digitize an important collection of Roman art, the Perseus Project and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, have addressed these and other questions. This paper will focus on the development of a new archive of photographs, and discuss the decision-making and technical processes behind delivering high-resolution images of museum objects via the Web. Copyright protection, storage and delivery of many large files, interface, the viewer's experience, curatorial concerns, and other issues have been important considerations. Underlying our efforts has been the belief that, in the new environment of networked access to museum resources, museums have an opportunity to transform education."

It will address: content development, funding, technical challenges and opportunities. The issue of content development is of primary importance for the heritage sector. While for other content providers, individuality is almost a prerequisite, in the area of the representation of public history and heritage, there are a number of constraints Heritage institutions (museums, archives, historic sites, etc.) and organizations (historical societies, genealogical societies, ethnocultural societies, etc.) are a part of the non-profit sector and also make extensive use of volunteers. Thus, an under-resourced sector is being called upon to make use of a new technology without the necessary resources, fiscal or human to do so. Is doing things on a shoe-string possible? How can we get heritage content on the web? While many roadblocks can be identified, it would be foolhardy for the sector to avoid getting started. Much can be accomplished using the traditional techniques that are hallmarks of the sector."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses an online module: Museums and Galleries: The Cultures of Display for Junior level, undergraduate art history students at Richmond, the American International University in London (RAIUL). Published on the University's IntraNet, this module is part of a university-wide IT and Teaching Initiative. We specifically address the educational rationale for the project with reference to the institutional context and the impact of such developments on the University's support services. The initial section of the paper focuses on the practical implementation of the online module with reference to a pedagogical framework. The online module enables students to have online access to module content as well as a summary of the curriculum, lists of set texts, assignment criteria and assessment deadlines. Museum-specific pages with external hyperlinks to museums are published in preparation for on-site visits. Class messages are posted as well as research resources. Faculty - student email communication is used extensively as well students emailing museum personnel. Recently the site has been developed to include a study skills section to assist students\\' development of critical analysis techniques when using web-based resources. Subsequently, the paper examines the module from the perspective of the student and the faculty drawn from evaluation data gained in the three iterations of this module. This will examine student attitudes to online content delivery and analyse intended and actual student usage of the online module. From the faculty perspective we will address the practical issues of developing an online course. This will focus particularly on display and the aesthetics of on-screen presentation. In addition, we will reflect upon the issues raised by this module at the university-wide level with regarding to support implications for the development of more online courses. The paper will conclude with proposals for the way forward in the future development of the project, particularly with respect to inter-institutional collaboration, both with museums and other Higher Education providers in the United Kingdom."

    "abstract": "Often, topics can be taught online that are unteachable in other media. One such topic is materials science and art -- an increasingly popular topic for art museum visitors. This is a visual subject, which requires visual materials for teaching and learning. Books, articles, slides, videos are often unavailable, inaccessible or in an unuseable form, and the physical nature of museum objects generally precludes side-by-side comparisons. To identify the underdrawing of a painting, one must be able to superimpose infrared and normal photographs of the painting. To authenticate a particular Greek kouros, one has to be able to view it from all angles for comparison with authentic kouroi. Pictures in books, and discreet kouroi in different museums will not accomplish that. The material must be made available in a useful form. We are now completing a 1 1/2 year project (an NSF sponsored partnership between Brandeis and the National Gallery of Art), for an interactive web site about Bellini's Feast of the Gods. This exhibit should be online in late January. Our exhibit, Investigating Bellini's Feast of the Gods, considers a single painting. Within the period 1514-29, it was painted and overpainted three times. Scientific data are presented, enabling the viewer to reconstruct interactively the various versions and reasons for the overpaintings. The viewer discovers the chemistry of the pigments and their degradation, how the scientific investigation was performed and how to identify the various painters. Uniquely the exhibit allows the viewer to manipulate imagesmagnifying, superimposing, and comparing. The painting is examined in great detail. Our paper will address the specific technologies and pedagogical approaches which we have used that may have direct application to other art-and-science web sites. For example, a common challenge is to make one exhibit that is useful to many different audiences. It is important not to lower the common denominator too low, or the exhibit will be useless for all. This is easier to accomplish in an online exhibit than in a physical one because whole sections on a site can be geared toward more knowledgeable visitors without disrupting the experience for others. Another approach -- which has been very successful for us -- has been to limit the scope of our subject matter. By focussing on depth rather than breadth, often experts and non-experts alike are able to wholly follow a narrow topic without being overwhelmed with too many academic concepts. We are thus able to keep the level of sophistication quite high."

    "abstract": "What makes a good online exhibit? Good content, a narrative theme, intuitive navigation, and inviting graphics. The online “exhibit” has recently emerged as a highly successful motif -- favored over the “virtual museum,” and “online magazine” -- and is a vital component of any successful museum site; but what, specifically, makes them good? We have performed an extensive survey of online offerings, and have identified many common qualities of successful exhibits. Our efforts stem from development of the “WebExhibits Catalogue,” a new -- and very successful -- resource for finding high quality exhibits on the internet. Our catalogue links directly to exhibits within other sites, on topics including arts, sciences, and popular culture. We currently index over 500 exhibits and estimate that our survey includes more than half of all substantive English language exhibits. This index differs from other indexes on the internet because it is focused on illustrated educational exhibits, not just references. Some of the exhibits are from large organizations like the National Gallery, National Geographic or PBS, while others are smaller, little-known exhibits from various organizations. We find that visitors respond very favorably to sites that offer a lot of narrative guidance simultaneously with great ease of navigation. With advances in bandwidth and interactive capabilities like JavaScript, Flash, streaming media, and DHTML, web sites can be as interactive as CD-ROM\\'s promised to be a few year ago. In fact, by dynamically interfacing with server-side databases, web sites can be more dynamic than CD-ROM. Despite these, advances, however, it is our experience that the most important quality of an exhibit (besides content, of course) is ease of navigation. This is more important than \\\"cool graphics,\\\" and certainly more important than any animations or sounds. It is vital that a visitor be immediately able to perceive the conceptual structure of the exhibit: what is available, and where information is located. Moreover, since visitors have become apprehensive about clicking uncertain hyperlinks, it is vital that visitors always be able to anticipate exactly what a link will bring. Our paper will draw from our extensive catalogue of exhibits to illustrate the shared qualities of good exhibits, including specific (cost effective) recommendations for new authors. For example, technologies that improve navigation are JavaScript/DHTML pop-up hierarchical menus that jump visitors to other sections of a site without cluttering the screen. We will also focus on a number of general subjective aspects of good exhibit design, such as creating a succinct, yet compelling story line to pull the visitor through the exhibit."

    "abstract": "As technology advances, we can create increasingly sophisticated experiences in distributed environments (distributed learning refers to learning experiences in which individuals and groups of learners and instructors are separated in time and/or space), including collaborative design and learning events, shared performances and exhibits, and multi-site research and scholarly communities. Implementing these new experiences will require the invention of new kinds of spaces that integrate virtual and on-site experiences seamlessly, and that facilitate participation by many people concurrently. These new physical and technical formats will have profound implications for the way educational and cultural institutions manage space, link to the outside world, and provide services. The Stanford Learning Lab believes that learning is an outcome of communication and social interaction. The ways in which we learn are being transformed by advances in technology that alter communication and interaction. For example, facilitated by fast, reliable, high bandwidth networks a research team can be created from among experts who are physically located across the globe, and assembled only virtually. This team can meet virtually, and discuss in a virtual public conversation documents, files, drawings, video or audio artifacts etc that were privately held until prior to the meeting, modify and change this information together, re-assemble the pieces, re-claim any portion of the new documents or files all without face-to-face meeting or lapses in time. They can choose to communicate synchronously and/or they can choose to record their communication for sharing at a preferred time. Information is instantaneously accessible, and distributed. Opportunities for active and effective collaboration are limitless except as they might be constrained by time zone, ethnicity, expertise and/or cultural differences. The world of access and knowledge implied in the global collaboration suggested above is indicative of a hybrid virtual and physical environment in which most of us will learn in the next decade. The physical space will be an extension of a web of interconnected virtual environments and an extrapolation of other remote physical environments. The possibilities for learning, for collaborative making, and for intimate connections globally in such an environment are enormous. This paper outlines a three-track research program undertaken by the Stanford Learning Laboratory(SLL) to explore and define these new kinds of hybrid --- i.e. mixed virtual and physical -- environments for the support of distributed interactive experience in schools and in cultural institutions. Our goal is to design spaces for distributed activity that will support complex, socially rich, learning and will promote a sense of community amongst participants."

    "abstract": "One of the things that make the web exciting for museums is that setting up virtual exhibitions is so easy. You don't need much money, nor altering the physical structures of your museum in any way. This fact is going to change the way museums and private companies collaborate: you don't need \"heavy\" sponsorships to make your ideas come true. Moreover, new kinds of sponsorships are coming to life. Private firms can give you money, but not money only: they can give you visibility on their websites; they can give you graphic artists or programmers you could never afford; they can host your pages on powerful servers with fast connections. Now that the Internet is boosting all over Europe and private companies have started investing more money on their web operations, web sponsorships are growing in importance, and getting companies' attention is becoming easier for a museum. Web sponsorships can also be important as a first step in establishing collaboration; positive results can drive to sponsorships to the real museums. On the other hand, you have to take web operations very seriously, in order to make your sponsors happy. The Milan Science Museum web staff has been setting up this kind of sponsorships since the very first days of the website; some of them have proved successful, while others have produced little or no results. By presenting some of this case-histories, we hope to provide other museums ideas for their own web-based sponsored operations."

    "abstract": "Can you imagine how a today city could have been many centuries ago, say, in the Renaissance, or in the Baroque period? Did you ever desire to explore that city not only as it is now, but also as it was at those times? And wouldn't you like to get explanations of what you are seeing while you proceed in your exploration? We are developing a web system that allows you to meet these desiderata in a virtual world. Our system allows the developer to integrate a number of 3D virtual reconstructions of the urban structures of a city (e.g., streets, squares, buildings, etc.), each one representing the city in a different period of time. End users can not only navigate each virtual space, e.g., \"walking\" along a street or getting into a building of the virtual town in a given period, but can also select a different historical period and switch to the representation of the same urban context in that time period. In this way, users can experiment a form of navigation which exploits two dimensions of virtuality: the virtual space, reconstructed via 3Dgraphics, and the virtual time, which is achieved by the possibility of switching among different temporal frameworks. In addition, at any point of space and time, the user can get various kinds of information concerning what (s)he is currently exploring, by jumping into a \"traditional\" 2D information space made of textual or multimedia web pages. From a technological perspective, the system uses: VRML for implementing 3D representations of urban structures, where users visualize themselves as avatars in the virtual worlds; World-view as VRML viewer; Java for loading of dynamically created virtual contexts XML for the representation of Web pages linked to the VRML virtual worlds The final paper will present the motivations of the project, will discuss the various modes of user interaction and navigation available in the system (\"walk\", where the user perceives him/herself as virtual actor embedded in the virtual space, and \"fly\", where (s)he has a panoramic, \"from-the-sky\" view of the space context) , and will describe technical aspects of the system. The approach will be exemplified by presenting a case study, based on the 3D-multitemporal reconstruction of Milan along various periods, from the 15th century to today."

    "abstract": "The New Museum of Contemporary Art's Education department has been working with alternative high schools and at-risk students in the New York area since 1984 as part of the Visible Knowledge Program (VKP). Pairing artist-instructors with classroom teachers on a semester or year-long basis, the Education department provides professional development and technological support to VKP participants collaborating on the integration of contemporary art with core high school curricula (Social Studies, English, Science) and the development of online Classrooms and Studios. In liaison with museum staff, the teachers and artist-instructors develop and teach weekly lessons that explore the connections between contemporary art practice and current cultural and social issues introduced in the different subject areas. Launched in March 1999, the Visible Knowledge Program Web site (http://www.vkp.org) uses cold fusion programming to provide an interactive and continually expanding resource and work space for educators, artists and students. The site complements the practical in-class learning experience by providing a cyber learning environment consisting of four areasClassrooms, Studios, Galleries and a Library. The Classroom and Studio spaces offer participants individual or group work areas to upload images of student and artists work, personal statements and lesson plans in progress. Both the Curriculum Units and the Classrooms are linked to Forums where visitors and registered users may participate in dialogue and offer feedback on the lesson plans and posted work. The eventual goal of the VKP Web site is to reach and support educators worldwide. As the site is still quite new, the activity online consists only of the teachers and students from the schools with which the museum has established collaborative programs. Even at that, the use of the site has been sporadic. The challenge the department now faces is how to fully incorporate the site into the classroom learning process and then successfully extend it in an organic manner specific to each unique group of students. During my presentation, I will address the difficulties I face in trying to incorporate a web-based program into the \"real\" classroom where teachers and artists are somewhat resistant to new media. I will also discuss the measures I have taken to generate more interest in and activity on the site and offer suggestions to other web administrators and museum educators for sustained participation, both online and in the classroom, throughout a collaboration. Lastly, I will present some solutions for effectively using a web component in the classroom so that it meets the needs of both the teacher and the students."

    "abstract": "The Skirball Cultural Center is currently in the midst of a major redesign of it's web site to transform it from being a simple electronic brochure to a more effective content-driven site. The purpose of the redesign is showcase the institution, and to add more dynamic content such as virtual exhibits, e-commerce, educational curriculum, research material and more. Although the redesign process is in itself quite interesting, there is one particular component of the site that uniquely address two of the principal strengths and functions of the world wide web- links and the collaborative process. The distinctive attribute for this web project that we are developing is the use of contextual links. Our goal is to propel the actual nature of the web by designing the framework for nonlinear narrative that utilizes a scheme of contextual links to the websites of other cultural museums. Most hyper-links follow a linear model where a user enters a site and selects a link (either text or an image) to navigate within the site or be taken to another, related site or web portal. Also, the main collaborations occurring between institutions usually relate to the sharing of technology, to linking to relevant content or for sharing on-line visitors. We are collaborating on interinstitutional content development This project can be described as a virtual \"Rashomon\" - the telling of similar narratives but told from different voices, and in our case, the stories of immigrant communities in America. The method for accomplishing this type narrative is that individual institutions develop websites about stories of their own specific communities and concurrently collaborate with other institutions about the interactions with other communities. The prototype being developed by the Skirball Cultural is the story of a Russian Jewish family that immigrated to Los Angeles in the 1920's. Within this particular narrative, there are anecdotes relating to the interactions and relationships with a family of Japanese immigrants whose story is being developed by the Japanese American National Museum. Everywhere there is a relationship between the two families, there is a hyper link between the two web sites that jumps directly to the correlated narrative within the partner institution's site. The prototype method for this virtual \"Rashomon\" uses a combination of straight fact and historical fiction to tell the individual stories about the \"Gimovskys\", the \"Nakamuras\", their relationships and shared experiences. Future plans include collaborations with other cultural centers and museums across the country, along with the development of educational curriculum for schools."

    "abstract": "Since 1996, Canada's Digital Collections (CDC), a federal government program, has been helping organizations across Canada build a stock of high-quality Canadian content on the Internet. The central focus of the program has been to provide on-the-job experience in information technology for young Canadians. Using an innovative approach to skills development and employment, CDC provides funds for museums, libraries, archives, firms, schools, and other organizations to hire teams of youth to digitize significant Canadian holdings and create dynamic multimedia web sites. This paper will outline the benefits to museums and cultural institutions of a successful model for economical digitization and internet-based access to analogue materials. Specifically, this paper will describe the unique design of the CDC program: objectives, components and delivery. CDC provides the structure, technical guidelines and expert advice that enable even novice participants to execute publication-quality Web products. In particular, CDC is a cost-effective funding model for developing partnerships among governments, cultural institutions and entrepreneurial youth. On the one hand, cultural institutions benefit by receiving funds for the digitization of museum collections and other holdings reflecting Canadian identity. On the other hand, youth between the ages of 15 and 30 develop information technology and business skills and experience by participating in short-term multimedia and digitization projects. The youth also learn about their country through the process of creating these websites. One of the most important sources of Canadian content on the Internet, Canada's Digital Collections currently houses over 320 web sites ranging from the treasures of Canadian institutions such as the National Library of Canada, the National Archives and the Museum of Civilization, to the local histories and way of life of Canadian communities. Take a virtual tour through some of the web sites created by youth from Canada's museum resources: Canada's Innovative Aviation Heritage: the stories of Canadair and de Havilland Canada (http://collections.ic.gc.ca/canadair/) Fossils of Nova Scotia (http://collections.ic.gc.ca/fossils/) Emily Carr (http://www.tbc.gov.bc.ca/culture/schoolnet/carr/)"

    "abstract": "All art museums, small or large, basically share the same mission to communicate to the public about their collections. This is ratified in the statutes of the International Council of Museums (ICOM). A Web site is a publishing tool and may as such be used to further this educational mission. Small art museums in that respect share the same goals as larger institutions, but their circumstances are very different. They are most often understaffed and managing an very limited financial resources, and these circumstances must be expected to impose same limitations an the amount of time, money and effort they are able to devote to developing and maintaining a web site. In a 1996 survey of UK museums it was concluded, not surprisingly, that lack of training and resources was the main reason why smaller institutions were not present an the Web. The goal of this research is to take a closer look at the problems of small museums with regards to this new medium, by presenting an example of how they may be solved. It presents a case study of the development of a web site for Vejen Art Museum, a small art museum in Denmark, and it aims to investigate how an art museum with very limited resources might realistically make use of the web for publishing information. It is the overall aim of this research to investigate the issues involved in the development and maintenance of a Web site for a small art museum. There are three central points of investigation: l. How may a web site fit into the general information strategy of a museum. 2. What are the minimal requirements in relation to financial investment and work effort. 3. How is the work best organised in order to make the process as economical and effective as possible. This case study may serve as an example to other small art museums contemplating the development of a web site. Not because it is exemplary in the sense of being perfect, but because it highlights the issues and problem areas of such a project. It is not possible to draw ultimate conclusions as to the perfect way to use the medium, as any museum will have to take into consideration their special needs, abilities and circumstances. The real strength and value of a case study like this is that the experiences learned may give museum professionals and others involved in similar projects a sense of the tasks at hand."

    "abstract": "Since the material and informational assets of our cultural institutions are now liberated from bricks and mortar, the challenge facing museum professionals and educators is how to best apply technology to fulfill the needs of the general population and the aspirations of the institutions. Against the backdrop of the popular PBS production, The Antiques Road Show; Prolegomenon version .1 integrates the foreword thinking of James Burke's work The Knowledge Web, and presents how the traditional museum-based orientation of artifact-as-history can finally fulfill our highest democratic ideals of education, once stated by John Dewey. Those ideals now have an opportunity to be fulfilled in the triune function of CONTENT, CURRICULUM, and COMMUNITY, a credo that is embraced by efforts like bigchalk.com, sponsor of our current work in this arena. Prolegomenon version.1 projects a blueprint as to how the cultural assets of museums can provide a true interdisciplinary approach to learning that will reflect Burke\\'s suggested,\\\" glimpse of what a learning experience might be like in the twenty-first century.\\\" It is the beginning of a community-based dialogue related to evolving an enhanced philosophy and practice of education."

    "abstract": "With internet access in schools rapidly becoming the norm, it could be said the “horses” are at the water--but are they drinking? In the fall of 1999, we polled 750 elementary and secondary teachers in our local audience about their online habits. Our survey asked them to rate how frequently they use the internet in a variety of ways, ranging from checking e-mail to searching for lesson plans to incorporating online activities in their lessons. 88% of our sample reported some degree of internet use, most commonly checking e-mail. A surprisingly high number reported incorporating the internet into their lesson preparation and student assignments. These results should cheer technology promoters--most of our teachers are at least sipping from the waters of the internet! We now have a chance to apply what we have learned about teachers\\' habits to provide them with applications that meet their current comfort levels and encourage them to do still more."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses how a museum can partner with an established commercial entity to utilize more effectively the Internet to reach the museum\\'s constituency, establish a professional Internet presence, increase merchandise sales, simplify museum gift shop operations and more proficiently use scarce capital resources. Museums have Internet sites that range from modest translations of their brochures to award winning multimedia presentations. However, Internet funding and the talent to develop Internet sites are both scarce. Partnering with an established, reputable commercial entity to develop a professional Internet presence while at the same time enjoying the benefits of increased Internet gift shop traffic is a powerful combination. This concept is made even more attractive because it can be done at no additional cost to the museum and will result in substantial cost savings. In summary, such as partnership can (i) achieve better member outreach through a professional Internet presence and analysis of member purchasing behavior, (ii) stimulate product development based on commercial viability of the product and the various planned exhibitions (iii) dramatically improve onsite and Internet museum shop operations by reducing onsite inventory, providing additional Internet product opportunities and offering one stop fulfillment and (iv) reduce the financial commitment to shop inventory while developing additional revenue sources."

    "url": "https://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2000/papers/jones/jones.html",
    "year": "2000",
    "abstract": "Historically, museums have been the place of rare and often valuable collections, preserved and displayed predominantly for their aesthetic value. These collecting museums did not intend to educate; however, after World War II, modern science museums and children's museums were created around the message they wished to espouse rather than a collection they wished to exhibit (Weinberg and Elieli. The Holocaust Museum in Washington. New York: Rizzoli, 1995: 50). Instead of the collection as a museum's commodity, Eilean Hooper-Greenhill concludes that \"Knowledge is now well understood as the commodity that museums offer\" (Museum, Message, Media. London: Routledge, 1995: 2). In discussing historical museums, Weinberg and Elieli state that in such a museum, the narrative arranges knowledge like \"building blocks in a continuous story line [designed to] educate in the sense of changing and developing their visitors mentally, emotionally, or morally\" (The Holocaust Museum in Washington. New York: Rizzoli, 1995: 49). Such education is rhetorical, and as such requires, according to social critic Kenneth Burke, the establishment of identification. He writes, \"You persuade a man only insofar as you can talk his language by speech, gesture, tonality, order, image, attitude, idea, identifying your ways with his\" (Burke, The Rhetoric of Motives New York: Prentice-Hall, 1950: 55; original emphasis). In order for a museum exhibit to persuade and thereby educate its audience, it must establish identification with that audience. Turning first to the physical presence of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), I will show how the designers of the Permanent Exhibition of the USHMM have attempted to build identification throughout the museum through the display of personal artifacts, as ordinary and yet as intimate as shoes and toothbrushes; and photographs, which emphasize the individual humanity of the victims rather than massive dehumanization of entire cultural groups. After I have illustrated some of the ways in which a physical museum attempts to establish identification, I will turn my attention to the ways in which a museum's online presence can also establish identification by which to educate and persuade its audience. Demonstrating goodwill toward the audience of an online museum, a largely anonymous and widely diverse audience, is more difficult than establishing identification with visitors to a physical space. First of all, there are no physical beings with whom to identify; cyberspace breeds an impersonal environment. Furthermore, designers of online museum exhibits do not have the luxury of spinning knowledge with a single, narrative thread; cyberspace valorizes hypertextuality-not linearity. Nevertheless, online museum designers can still work to establish identification with their cyber visitors. Looking at the online presence of two Holocaust museums, the USHMM http://www.ushmm.org and Yad Vashem http://www.yad-vashem.org, I will attempt to show design components that help to establish identification, as well as to suggest other ways that identification could be utilized in these online museums-and others."

    "abstract": "This presentation will highlight the results of recent research in which ten art museum web sites were examined using a self-designed three-part investigative matrix that identifies and applies specific criteria to each web site. The three main components of the investigative matrix are: technological, design and source considerations of the Web; characteristics of the Web and web use thought to enhance learning; and, the National Visual Arts Standards. Criteria relating to technological, design and source considerations of the Web include: (1) scope of content; (2) content validity/verifiability of details; (3) currency of information; (4) credibility of source; (5) point of view/bias/objectivity; (6) layout/design/navigation; (7) media integration; and, (8) interactivity/usability. Criteria relating to characteristics of the Web and web use thought to enhance learning include: (1) the unbounded nature of web information; (2) connectivity of web site content with related and divergent information; (3) user-centered content and design; (4) self-guided/direct manipulation and control by users; (5) increased user motivation; and, (6) encouraging new ways of learning how to learn. The six content standards of the National Visual Arts Standards are: (1) understanding and applying media, techniques and processes; (2) using knowledge of structures and functions [in art]; (3) choosing and evaluating a range of subject matter, symbols and ideas; (4) understanding the visual arts in relation to history and cultures; (5) reflecting upon and assessing the characteristics and merits of [the student's art] work and the work of others; and (6) making connections between the visual arts and other disciplines (National Art Education Association, 1994). Following an introductory literature review and detailed discussion and definition of each matrix component, the ten art museum web sites are analyzed in terms of their adherence to the criteria in the investigative matrix. The ten art museum web sites examined in this study fall into one of five categories: flagship/large art museums, regional/local art museums, university art museums, special interest/ethnic art museums, and on-line art museums. ArtsConnectEd (http://www.artsconnected.org) ; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (http://www.guggenheim.org/solomon/index.html); the Silicon Valley Institute of Art and Technology (http://www.art-tech.org/indexv4.html); the National Museum of Wildlife Art (http://www.wildlife.org/homepage.html); Indiana University Art Museum (http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eiuam/main.html); the Helen Foresman Spencer Museum of Art (http://www.cc.ukans.edu/~sma/); The Museum for African Art (http://www.africanart.org); the Museum of International Folk Art (http://www.state.nm.us/moifa/MOIFAhome/MOIFAhome.html); ArtMuseum.net (http://www.artmuseum.net); and, The American Museum of Photography (http://www.photographymuseum.com) are the art museum web sites involved in the investigation. The main goal of this study is to provide art and museum educators with a methodology that can be used to investigate additional art museum web sites and web sites with art education related content. Using this method, art and museum educators, as well as educators from other disciplines, can conduct future exploration into the technological and educational aspects, as well as adherence to the National Visual Arts Standards, of other web sites they may want to use to meet their pedagogical needs."

    "abstract": "The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has launched a number of initiatives designed to provide teachers and learners with high-quality, standards-based curriculum materials via the World Wide Web. Among these initiatives is our project, the CUIP/Museum Collaboration. This paper will discuss the timeline and process of creating these curriculum modules, highlighting the truly collaboratory nature of the project at all levels, and discuss the lessons we have learned throughout this first year. The presentation will also include a demonstration of the modules in their preliminary stages. The Chicago Public Schools/University of Chicago Internet Project (CUIP) is a cooperative effort between CPS and the University of Chicago. The project's main focus is on making computers and the Web accessible to a cluster of twenty-nine south-side Chicago schools. CUIP also devotes much of its resources to teacher training. It runs a summer Web Institute for Teachers, that teaches teachers how to build curriculum modules utilizing resources available on the Web. Although this training and the modules produced by teachers have dramatically increased the use of the Internet in CUIP schools, teachers rarely have the time necessary to produce high-quality curriculum modules during the academic year. Similarly, while museums are increasingly creating web-based curriculum materials, these materials are often limited by the scope of the museums' collections or expertise. In order to expand the reach of the museums and ensure that the educational materials are usable by teachers, we proposed a collaboration among the University, the CUIP schools, and several Chicago-area museums in April of 1999. The CUIP/Museum Collaboration capitalizes on the amount of high-quality museums in the Chicago area by developing materials that utilize the resources of multiple institutions. The involvement of teachers from the beginning ensures that the project will develop curriculum relevant to the needs of CUIP teachers and students. Funded by the Chicago Public Schools, the CUIP/Museum Collaboration involves three CUIP staff members with expertise in curriculum, museum education, and Web design, nine exceptional CUIP teachers from all levels, and representatives from the Field Museum of Natural History's UrbanWatch Program, the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry, and the Oriental Institute Museum. The teachers choose the topics of the four modules according to their classroom needs and curriculum deficiencies. The museum educators assist in the creation of the modules by pointing out the most effective ways their respective collections can be used. The CUIP staff members, working closely with these two groups, write the content for the modules, which will contain engaged learning activities for the Web, classroom, and community. Teachers are involved because they want to find new and compelling ways of addressing the standards, and the museums make this possible by working together and using their collections to complement what needs to be learned in the classroom. The CUIP/Museum Collaboration not only puts the museum in the classroom, these modules enable students to make use of multiple museums at once."

    "abstract": "This paper examines how monitoring the access and use of web-based museum collections can improve the overall quality of artifact data. All databases have quality problems that arise both from input errors and also from errors that emerge over time; museum databases are no exception. Indeed, the complexity and variety of the information recorded in museum databases actually adds to the probability of such errors occurring. Given the expense of checking through each record for errors, we are exploring alternative approaches that can contribute to the improvement of data quality for web-accessible museum database systems. Since 1997, the Spurlock Museum at the University of Illinois has been performing a complete re-inventory of its collection, developing in the process an extensive database of artifact data available online. This project has required the cooperation of museum staff members, various external experts, and dozens of part-time undergraduate student employees. During the process of data gathering, entry, and analysis, an unexpected phenomenon was observed: in accessing and using the data, individuals have consistently detected errors, reported them, and even volunteered corrections. However, these individuals were not directly involved in the task of searching for errors; they were instead working on other tasks. For example, a curator working remotely over the Internet to plan a new exhibit for the museum retrieved several artifact records using his web browser. In one of these records, he found an erroneous entry and sent an email to the museum's registrar, noting the error and suggesting a correction. The relative frequency of this kind of activity raises a question: can web-accessible museum collections incorporate mechanisms that will allow people browsing the data to report errors they detect and, should they wish, volunteer corrections? Although clearly this will not happen for every database record, we need to understand more about the process of error recognition and correction in order to facilitate it when it does occur. This paper will present the results of our study of unexpected error detection and correction in the Spurlock Museum artifact database. Through an analysis of this phenomenon, we explore how to encourage such data correction behavior explicitly, effectively and efficiently. We also note the importance of establishing and encouraging a community that will support collaborative data correction activities."

The on-line exhibition is comprised of electronically scanned images from the permanent collections of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, VA and the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum, Hildesheim, Germany. The Web-site simulates a classroom from which students and educators embark on a virtual \"field trip\" into the exhibition of ancient Egyptian art. In bringing together objects in an electronically reproduced format which would otherwise not be seen together in a physical environment, this Web-site extends access to the permanent and temporary collections of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts to classrooms throughout the county via the Internet. Audience development, access, and education are all key components as the exhibition is accompanied by a virtual \"supply closet\" of materials and techniques, \"lessons,\"\"maps,\"\"vocabulary,\"\"family room,\" and \"teacher's lounge.\" Lesson plans written to reference the Commonwealth of Virginia Standards of Learning Objectives encourage the creation of original artwork in remote classrooms, adaptable to grade levels Kindergarten through High School. This mini-workshop will present the Web-site as an educational tool from the collaborative efforts of those involved in its development to its application to the classroom."

    "abstract": "Guidelines for Web site design include presentation structure and the use of descriptors for each component page. A hierarchic structure facilitates theme development through initial presentation of thematic context followed by thematic details placed within the structure. However, a presentation with well described detail pages invites search engine entry through the “side-door,” i.e. directly to detail pages within the presentation structure by using the page descriptors. A virtual visitor can quickly get lost, loose interest, and go away, without discovering the context of the retrieved information. This paper presents a 3-year usage study based on the log data collected from a hypermedia exhibit designed to present a sampling of research projects in the social sciences. The exhibit has resided at 3 locations, in a natural science museum as part of a traditional exhibit, as an information kiosk, and currently as an independent Web site at http://nordbotten.com/museum. Users from the general public of each location were free to explore the exhibit. The underlying purpose of the study has been to study usage patterns for in-house hypermedia presentations vs Web presentations. If the usage patterns observed for in-house presentations are similar to those for Web presentations, than they could be used as guidelines for Web presentation development. Our data shows little similarity between the in-house and Web usage patterns. Most, 80%, of the Web sessions were started from a search engine request, of which 60 % started at a detail page. These latter sessions were significantly shorter (p=0.00039) than sessions begun at the start of the exhibit."

Each one of the virtual visitors can remotely explore the Virtual world. In addition a virtual visitor can examine and interact with components of the world. Like in a real world situation, a visitor can see where the other visitors are currently located, where they are going, and what they are doing. Visitors exchange opinions or information, with other visitors, through the keyboard. Visitors can interact with 3D objects, sharing the experience of the interaction, with other visitors. An experimental application of \"Webtalk I\" was presented last year during the closing plenary of MW 99. It consisted of a reconstruction of a virtual museum, based on the Milan Science Museum, in which visitors could operate Leonardo's machines. With by experience of \"Webtalk I\" become due new requirement and put new scope to get over some limits of the system. \"Webtalk II\" 's architecture allowed to go beyond bottle's neck over the server and over the client; it allowed to link with a lot of user, thanks to use of the multicast; and it will guarantee the automatic generation of the worlds and three dimensional objects, looding from database 3D. Furthermore, with \"Webtalk II\", the appearance of the cooperation between the users reinforced through the formality of the further cooperative metaphor. After extensive testing, the environment, called \"Virtual Leonardo\" was officially opened to the public on June 7, 1999, in an extended and debugged version. In this paper we evaluate the results of the first 6 month: how many visitors we had, what they did, the problems they had, the suggestions they gave us. We tried also some experimental virtual guided tours (one during ICHIM 99), with interesting results in educational terms."

    "abstract": "In the United States alone, over 99 million people are online, an increase of over 43 percent from the previous year. If these trends continue, over 200 million Americans will be utilizing the Internet by the year 2002. With new technologies come new opportunities to reach a wider array of audiences and, at the same time, expand a museum's cultural goals within a new community of visitors. A museum's web site, however, should not merely function as a source for disseminating information; it should also serve as the de facto museum, only online. Currently, most museums provide the end-user with information: general, upcoming and current exhibitions, collections, parking and directions, etc. The result: curatorial and public relations departments receive a strong web presence at the expense of visitor services, retail sales, and development departments. This paper will investigate ways that both small and larger institutions can make their web site mirror the full functionality of the physical museum through the possibilities of e-commerce. Since the late 1980s when the government began to reduce funding to the cultural community, it has become paramount for museums to take innovative approaches to procure funding. For larger institutions the trend in recent years has been to put on blockbuster exhibitions to bring in additional visitors and, as a result, an increased revenue stream. Consider also that Forrester Research has recognized the ticketing industry as one of the top five services for which consumers will use the Internet. The result of these two parallel trends is that Internet ticketing is becoming a salient force in generating visitors to the museum. Another area where museums typically generate revenue is at the retail shop. By placing merchandise online, a visitor now has the opportunity to purchase merchandise directly from home. A third area that is typically neglected by museum web sites is the development department. Attracting members and donations is one of the most important goals of a museum and yet, the development department seldom appears on any museum web site. By giving Internet visitors the opportunity to donate and join the museum, avenues are being opened beyond the physical space of the museum. More importantly, this essay will address ways that museums can bring the under-utilized departments of the museum onto the web."

    "abstract": "This paper will be concerned initially with tracing the emergence of memory as a specific problem for Web Museums. Museums are not only dedicated to cultural heritage: they embody a specific conception of memory and patrimony. But Web Museums are faced with increasingly pressing issues of memory in the age of digital documents and multimedia reproduction. Digital multimedia networks condition, in part, the emergence of new patterns dealing with memory, but Web Museums may condition, in part, the evolution of these patterns. We shall trace the dissemination of artistic heritage in the age of globalization not just as problem of size but as integral to art. It is the necessary interconnection of memory and art that will open up the way in which problems of technical reproducibility and experience are presented and thought within elements of cultural heritage in the age of globalization. The technical reproducibility that is taken to mark out digital multimedia memory pertains not just to the nature of electronic networks but also to any thinking of the artwork and thus of the art Web museums. W. Benjamin emphazised the great capacities of technical reproducibility in matters of preservation. But he called attention to the serious need for another kind of transmission of memory, dealing with art, to ensure that memory will be disseminated in the future, not just as information, but as experience. Our point is to suggest that the dissemination of cultural heritage in the age of digital networks deals with the transmission of memory as experience and that Web Museums have a specific role to play as far as this artistic approach of memory is concerned. In order to reach this aim, they must emphazise their differences with \"CD-Rom Museums\" and exploit the woven structure of the net which fits the kind of memory that W. Benjamin wanted to disseminate through the paths of experience which meant form and content intermingled either in narrative figures or in artworks. Consequently particular attention will be given to those artworks for which the net is not only a tool for technical reproducibility but the very texture of the artwork and the exhibition place for its appearance or disappearance. Web museums are not bound to disseminate nothing but reproductions. They can be places where visitors are invited to construct their owns paths in virtual exhibitions, collaborate to the creation of a virtual artwork or share their experience with curators, artists, and museologists thanks to forums which re-enact the original function of the classic \"mouseion\". We shall analyse in which way emergent cultural Web sites are anticipating the prospects of Web Museums which must face the challenge of memory in the age of multimedia networks \"not as a machine but as a structure with its own memory, reacting as much to us as we interact with it--essentially an electronic central nervous system that will generate a productive situation between the public, the artist and the museologist\"(Swarz, \"The Virtual Museums on the Internet\", Salzburg, May 8-10, 1998)."

    "abstract": "Following the launch of the Centre for Maritime Research (CMR), the National Maritime Museum (NMM) has enhanced the collections databases already available on the Web with the addition of an impressive range of new and repackaged content. To complement the Museum's physical redevelopment programme, the very latest information and communications technology (ICT) has been harnessed to transform and substantially extend the CMR's online information services. These initiatives aim to extend the collections to a global audience, support research, facilitate the exchange of ideas, and encourage new approaches to the subject of maritime studies. This paper will look at its major online developments to date: the Search Station collections resource and Port the maritime information gateway. It will also highlight other initiatives and future plans including the Journal for Maritime Research and online conferencing. The Search Station is a multimedia resource providing thematic access to objects in the Museum\\'s collections. The NMM wanted to improve access to the two million objects in its Collections, and so undertook the production of a Search Station, as a pilot project to assess public access requirements. The Search Station offers access to highlights from the Collections, and currently contains almost two thousand exhibits. The content was created to both inform and entertain. Divided into six themes and over sixty topics with a variety of special features, the Search Station offers a user-friendly, innovative and informative resource to audiences ranging from school children and family groups to academic and commercial researchers. Produced in FileMaker Pro with an Internet Explorer web browser, the Search Station is a multi-faceted resource which opened on site in April 1999, and online http://www.nmm.ac.uk/searchstation. The production and extent of the content will be outlined, the user profile examined, and the future potential of the system highlighted. Port - an information gateway for maritime studies - employs the open-source software toolkit ROADS (Resource Organisation and Discovery in Subject-based Services) to provide a searchable and browseable catalogue of maritime-related Internet based resources. These resources are specially selected and described by a librarian or subject expert at the Museum. The software (produced by a consortium of developers as part of the UK\\'s Electronic Libraries Programme) is highly configurable and includes features such as a cataloguer\\'s interface and a link validation report. To the best if our knowledge, the NMM is the first Museum in the world to exploit this technology. Port also extends access to related materials developed by the CMR, materials such as a series of self-help research guides which provide information about the Museum\\'s collections and about other sources for research into maritime history. Port was launched at Easter 1999 and has seen an impressive increase in users over the past months. The development and marketing of Port will be examined and features of the gateway will be highlighted."

    "abstract": "Based on experience over the past year developing the next generation program “Making Sense of Modern Art,” this paper asks the question: what happens when you position yourself firmly in the dialectic between content and interactive functionality? Multimedia or Web-based projects are often characterized by a standard book-like or template-based design augmented by the occasional inclusion of video, audio, and/or animations. In developing the new version of “Making Sense,” we made a concerted effort to map our ways of thinking about and experiencing art more directly into the ways the screens function, designing a set of tools with names like Collaboration Web, Slider Gallery, Critical Reception Screen, and of course the old Pan-and-Zoom (with or without accompanying audio). These, plus Thematic Essays, Activities, and an Interactive Timeline that permits comparisons of works across the century, make the program a more pro-active exploration of artworks and their meanings. We will discuss our work flow processs: Research, with seminar-like discussions about each artist and work, followed by storyboarding and spec'ing out of potential goals appropriate to the variety of methodological approaches key to a given artwork. Generalization of these tools when appropriate, without stifling creative solutions for new animations, metaphors and juxtapositions Development of modular and recombinable elements for many screen-types Design of a Flash Generator database capable of generating the interactive Flash functionality for each of these screens Development of an interface that allows us to independently administer this database to generate new screens and add artworks at will. Augmentation of the catalog of database-generated screen types by selective hand-coding to assure variety of experience and spontaneity of feeling. The resulting program will be publishable not only on the Web, but to gallery-based kiosks/flat-panel stations, CD-ROMs (for easy distribution of high bandwidth material to the schools), and potentially to wearable computers and smart table technology. Subsets of content can be targeted to different audiences, locations, and delivery platforms. Topics of Interest treated: Web publication of content developed by and from Museums Interface design and beyond Database publishing Contracting out Internal Management of these processes Multi-platform delivery of Web-compatible content inside and outside Museum walls."

Unique to this exhibit was not only the visitors on-site access to the physical restoration of the 12' x 7' masterwork, but the opportunity for the public to view the “real time” progress of the project on the web. Conceived as an on-site/online project from the beginning, this was the first project of its type to be composed of collaborators from different departments and organizations within the museum. The resulting web program \"Restoration Online\" (www.artsmia.org/restoration_online) became one of the most popular projects to date. This paper will describe the process of developing this site, the factors that led to its success and the perspectives of the primary participants."

    "abstract": "The emergence of broadband technology has changed the Internet experience for millions of users. Faster Internet connections create opportunities and unique problems for Web developers. More compelling resources can be created for broadband connectionslarger (and/or more) graphics, better quality video, and more interactivity are a few of the options. However, most Web visitors dont have a broadband connection. The tension between taking advantage of the latest technology to create the most compelling experiences possible and creating resources that are accessible to a broad public audience is not a problem that is unique to developers in the museum worldbut it is one that is particularly sensitive given the fact that most museums receive some sort of public funding and have a mission to serve the community at large. Unlike the museum floor, users experiences with online resources have always differed due to factors such as connection-speed and the capabilities of their computers. The emergence of broadband (and faster computers) has made this problem more pronounced. So what are the options? What are the advantages that broadband presents? How can museums take advantage of what broadband offers without leaving other visitors behind? What technologies and techniques can developers use to create compelling online experiences that are \"scalable\" for visitors connecting at different speeds?"

During this time it has established a reputation as both an innovative and highly popular, Internet-based gateway to Australian museums and galleries. A recent study showed that from February 1998 to July 1999, AMOL received over two and a half million hits from 138,380 users, averaging out at more than 270 unique users a day. As well as individual users AMOL has also attracted a growing number of significant museum and gallery collections. But what have been the tangible and quantifiable benefits of this use and representation? Has the AMOL meta-center approach increased access to cultural resources and communications tools, in ways that have meaningfully benefit both museum professionals and the general public? The AMOL project team was mindful that it was time such questions were answered. Particularly when the number of Australian museums developing their own expensive OPACs grows and they begin to question the usefulness of a meta-center approach. In an effort to examine these issues and chart a way forward, AMOL commissioned the first of two remedial evaluations in late 1999. In this paper I intend looking at the results of the first quantitative evaluation and development of the second qualitative evaluation, as well discuss a range of marketing, promotional, educational and technological strategies the process has spurred."

    "abstract": "The persistence of memory is our umbilical cord to our past and our present. But what exactly is meant by \"memory?\" Memory can be defined in at least three ways: remembrance, or memory of a person or thing; memorial or record of an event; and memory as a power of the mind. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge about the Holocaust; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a democracy. In this paper, using three web exhibitions we will exemplify how these different notions of memory are addressed within the context of the Museum's mission. In the Voyage of the St. Louis (www.ushmm.org/stlouis) exhibition illustrates how the advancing and dissemination of knowledge about an event may be enhanced by not only a recitation of the history but also by transparently explaining the research process that resulted in our understanding of the history. Here memory is excavated and assembled to enhance the visitor's retention of the knowledge and understanding of the history. The Search section of the site includes an experiential component in which visitors are invited to engage in their own research, piecing together personal histories from documents and other fragments of memory. We hope that the element of memory as a power of the mind plays a role in the visitor remembering and learning through experience. In the Jewish Displaced Persons website (www.ushmm.org/dp) , the Museum employs personal remembrances in the form of oral testimonies to enhance the primary narrative of the exhibition. Statistics show that the oral testimonies are generally the first media visited and most frequently accessed. Given the important role of the oral tradition in our personal and collective memories of past events, how best can museums exploit this tradition in their on-line components. Last, in the Kristallnacht website (www.ushmm.org/kristallnacht) , we look at the Remembrances section of the site. This is a memorial space in which visitors are invited to leave remembrances. Its popularity with visitors raises the question of how to provide memorial spaces for visitor expression and social interaction online. How do visitors invest the space with their own thoughts and emotions?"

    "year": "2000",
    "abstract": "Currently, there is often a division of labor involved in virtual museum maintenance. The curator or administrator updates text, graphic, or multimedia content, and submits it to the webmaster, who then fits the page into the overall site design and uploads it to the web server. However, there are an increasing number of ways that they can both save time and hassle by enabling the curator or administrator to update the site herself. Museums whose goals include public education should consider the use of tools that allow non-technical staff to update the virtual museum without having to learn complicated software, style sheets, HTML, FTP, DHTML, and the myriad of other acronyms involved in site maintenance. Using a content management system, an easy-to-use interface allows an administrator to create new pages or update the content area on an existing page. The webmaster concentrates on the more complicated parts of the page, including the navigation bars, frames, popup menus, sounds, etc. There are also an increasing number of easy-to-use tools for creating pages. A webmaster can create the standard site template, and teach the curators the few things they'll need to know to get the job done. The webmaster can then focus on the design and template, instead of having to create each page himself. This paper explores the beginnings of a shift from web sites as technical challenges to web sites as tools for presentation and communication."

    "abstract": "The problems of access to and distribution of museum materials are at the heart of a number of initiatives undertaken by museum staff or agencies to draw on new technology to achieve a wider diffusion of museum and archival resources. For example, 13 Montreal history museums have joined together to provide teachers from greater Montreal and Quebec with an internet site containing information on educational activities designed for students at the primary, secondary and collegial levels. Within a broader context, CHIN's Gateway to Canadian learning Materials project is another initiative. The school-museum partnership is being renewed through the development of innovative technology-based initiatives to use museum objects and research directly in the classroom. Some ambitious projects, especially within the science museum world, have led the way. Technology might well prove a vehicle to bring museum resources into the classroom through the development of highly interactive multimedia databases linked directly to the curriculum.+ The McCord Museum of Canadian History, in partnership with the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, the Faculty of Education and Department of History from both McGill University and Université du Québec à Montréal, and the Quebec Ministry of Education, is working to create new material history-based resources for Canadian teachers. This project will focus on the development of curriculum-linked teaching resources, drawn from the collections of the partner museum. At the same time, the partner organizations will examine the delivery of such resources to the classroom. The project thus has two major areas of interest. The first is the integration of the museum model of learning using objects and images into the more traditional text-based curriculum materials of the primary and secondary schools. The second is the evaluation of the Internet as a medium for the diffusion of multimedia databases with age-specific interfaces, and its efficacy as a support for teaching and learning. This paper will discuss the McCord Museum involvement in those 3 projects."

However, a Web site that is not maintained and developed regularly starts to look tired and outdated much more quickly than the matching physical organization because of the fast-changing nature of the technology, and hence also the expectations of many on-line users. This paper explores what museums have achieved so far and discusses what second-generation museum Web sites might consider adding to their on-line facilities, through consideration of the results from two on-line museum surveys. The first surveyed virtual museum visitors, which may be a useful consideration for museums thinking about updating their Web site. The second more recent survey covers virtual museum sites themselves, and illustrates the current situation with respect to a significant cross-section of museum Web sites. Both surveys were undertaken in cooperation with the Virtual Library museums pages (VLmp), an on-line directory of museums."

    "abstract": "Artists like Fred Wilson challenged the logic separating the framing institution from the figure in the frame [the art], importing practices from the museum into the artwork and reversing this flow. New technologies, and specifically networked technologies, raise the need to investigate further the boundaries between the museum and the art \\\"within\\\" it, and the ways in which practices of displaying and the materials for doing so converge for museums on the web and web-based art. We see the Museum and the Web Conference as offering a unique opportunity to explore artistic practices of \\\"avant garde\\\" net-based art in terms of the institutional practices of curation; and the ways in which the two \\\"traditions\\\" share tools. Our web-based artwork \\\"DissemiNET\\\" is a Java-based system which hosts a cumulative, database of texts and images. DissemiNET re-elaborates terms such as \\\"origin,\\\" \\\"home(site),\\\" \\\"Diaspora,\\\" and \\\"search,\\\" in terms of and through the mechanisms of the web.Drawing parallels between diasporas and the dispersal of meaning over the web, DissemiNET in response provide spaces (lacunae) for people to recall and recollect, gathering there to re-tell stories about their own experiences with displacement and dispersal. Over time, DissemiNET becomes a collection of such stories of errancy. With \\\"DissemiNET\\\" we explore various notions of \\\"curation,\\\" among these the concept of \\\"automatic curation.\\\" Within the system we have developed an automatic indexing system ordered by a scheme of \\\"key words\\\" or \\\"themes\\\" (i.e.; \\\"kinship,\\\" \\\"home,\\\" etc.). The documents and images displayed in the DissemiNET browser self-select associations in relation to the curated set of themes. The themes also work within the system to allow a certain amount of control or curation to be turned over to the user. A visitor may trace visually the displacement and distribution of their chosen keywords or themes over the stories culled by the search engine. The \\\"automatic\\\" interventions of the system allow users of DisseminNET to touch an \\\"unconscious\\\" element of the archive which would otherwise only be constituted through conscious retelling. As artists/curators of the system, we have created a non-public, client-side authoring/editing/curatorial system with which the sets of texts, images, and the conceptual base of themes can be changed. The visualization of the site and the relationships/passages between images and texts may be reconfigured/reconceived through the use of this curatorial tool. **We propose to show \\\"DissemiNET\\\" as a prototype of a net-based curatorial system, and present it\\'s possible applications to museums for web-based presentation. **URLs: http://www.wexarts.org/thefold/disseminet[DissemiNEt webspace] http://www.wexarts.org/thefold/disseminet/documentation [documentation of installation @ Wexner Center for the Arts] \\\"DissemiNETion\\\" is currently on view at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Ohio as part of the exhibition \\\"Body MÈcanique: Artistic Explorations of Digital Realms,\\\" curated by Sarah Rogers.

I would propose that SCRAN is tackling the issues of intellectual access and resource discovery through the development of software tools to assist in these areas. SCRAN, the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network, is a Millennium project, spending £15,000,000 to build a networked multimedia resource base for the teaching and celebration of human history and material culture in Scotland. Although based on the museums, archives, libraries and built heritage of Scotland, SCRAN's prime concern is not with conservation, nor with documentation, but with educational access. Through extensive discussions with teachers, educators and education resource managers (20 meetings reaching just over 650 professionals) it became clear to SCRAN that making this material available over the internet was only the beginning of making the material accessible intellectually to educators and learners at all levels. The SCRAN resource base at http://www.scran.ac.uk/ presents a number of different access routes, depending on the needs of the end-user. 'Quick Search' presents a single letterbox into which the user can insert a simple keyword or a complete search expression including Boolean logic, truncation, wildcards, proximity operators and nesting, while 'Assisted Search' answers questions of the Who, What, Where, When variety. Both searches are good for retrieving whatever material SCRAN has on a particular topic. As well as these standard database features SCRAN has developed the following tools to aid the discovery and presentation of resources available through the SCRAN resource base.

    "url": "https://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw99/papers/cerulli/cerulli.html",
    "year": "1999",
    "abstract": "The paper is mainly concerned with the exploration of the potential of virtual, internet based, exhibition modes based on connectivity of the Web and on the peculiar spatiality of virtual environments. The narrative sense of the curators make the objects of the exhibit acquire much of their meaning. This applies to both physical and virtual Museums although, because of the intrinsic differences of physical space and cyberspace, the modes in which this narration is developed have to be different. In the virtual realm, the move from the objects of a collection to the meanings of an exhibition does not come only from linear juxtapositioning, grouping and sequencing of the objects but from hyperlinks with other objects and from the interactivity between the institution and the public. The paper will also deal with issues related to the development and implementation of 3D navigable exhibition spaces on-line. To provide a theoretical background to the virtual galleries design specific issues on the design of virtual environments will be addressed, regarding, in particular: navigation, orientation and interaction. In addition a prototype of a three dimensional virtual Gallery that experiments with the concepts of virtual Web based interactive environments and how they can relate to on-line exhibition spaces will be presented. The project was developed abstract virtual Gallery for the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow (GOMA)that does not attempt to reproduce or mimic the existing physical Gallery in its architectural Form and modes of exhibition. The designed prototype is now being implemented and tested. The interactivity features of VRML 2.0 worlds will be looked at. Amongst them there is the possibility to let the users reconfigure the virtual space which opens up a whole new set of possibilities for Museums on-line spaces. This feature could be of particular interest for an existing museum that could: * create virtual exhibits shared with other Museums, where the content of the exhibition are linked * provide the users with store material and to ask them to curate an exhibition in the 3D VRML World. This will encourage a dialogue on curatorial issues between the museum institution and the (virtual) visitors."

    "abstract": "As the growth of the World Wide Web changes how people access information and spend their leisure time, museum professionals need to learn about their new audience coming through the electronic doors just as they attempt to learn and meet the needs of those who walk through the physical doors of the museum. This research project is a first attempt to answer questions being asked by museum professionals - who is visiting a museum Web site, why people are visiting a museum Web site, and what do the online visitors do when they come to a museum Web site. While some of the hypotheses were not supported by the data collected in this study, some valuable information learned that should help museum professionals better understand their online visitors. An important finding is that groups, which accounted for approximately 30% of the respondents, accessed significantly more files than individuals while there was not a significant difference in the amount of time spent visiting the Web site. This paper focuses on the differences between individuals and groups in the way they visit a Web site. Possible explanations will be explored which suggest the need for further research. Some of the behaviors that take place in a museum can be observed in those accessing a museum Web site. This study suggests that people come to a museum Web site ready to learn and museums have an obligation not to squander the opportunity. Directions for future research will be discussed, including a closer look at the dynamics of groups visiting a museum Web site. This study was conducted from December 3, 1997 to February 8, 1998 at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Web site. A total of 348 respondents completed an online survey that was an adaptation of a previously used museum visitor study to determine why people choose to spend leisure time at a museum."

These changes are aimed at protecting the rights of copyright owners in the electronic environment, whether using Websites, Internet or any other technology not yet devised. The paper will examine the latest situation as this legislation passes through its many stages and also draw out some of the implications of the digital television revolution as it begins to be available to the general public. Owners and users are fighting a major battle to retain the balance of copyright and the outcome is not yet clear."

    "abstract": "Many museums have been quick to start using the web for the distribution of general information about exhibitions, opening times, and collections. Some have developed sophisticated virtual tours and on-line catalogues while others are more modest in their ambitions. However, all these developments have one thing in common: they push information out rather than pulling it in. One of the most interesting possibilities of the web is being neglected - using it as a front-end for distributed applications. For whatever reason, fear, angst, lack of technical expertise, or HTML allergy, many people shy away from developing web applications, but the potential is enormous. Because client stations require only a web browser, installation and maintenance are simplified, cross platform compatibility ceases to pose a problem and remote access stretches as far as the net will carry you. Start up a browser on any machine - not even your own -and your application and data are there waiting for you. In this presentation I want to explain how you can make distributed applications work efficiently using today's web technology, what the potential pit falls are and how to avoid them, and finally, take a brief look at the commercial implications of web distributed applications."

    "abstract": "Online art projects hold the potential of emergent behaviors, open public participation, and unanticipated results. Because of this spontaneous potential, one is confronted with dynamics that are different than those for exhibitions of pre-established objects. The curator's role extends beyond selection and presentation of pre-existing works, encompassing instead the guidance and supervision of ongoing events. The author speaks to several patterns that tend to emerge in both open and closed interactive systems. Drawing on examples from websites, museums, and MOO-spaces, emphasis is placed on alternatives that structure interactions in directed but flexible ways. The artist discusses programming and interface design as mechanisms for conducing particular creative behaviors, on-line discourses, etc. This paper will draw upon the artist's experiences with creating on-line interactive art. A concerted attempt will be made to bridge the technical and social discourses."

    "year": "1999",
    "abstract": "In the 1930s, scholars concluded that Homer, one of the greatest storytellers of the Western canon, probably used stock phrases according to context, using a simple replacement strategy. This is not unrelated to the innovative work being pursued by many artists including Maurice Benayoun, Toni Dove, Rebecca Allen, Jane Prophet, Simon Biggs, Paul Vanouse, and others, who use databases to auto-generate complex and often compelling dramatic tales in a process that is sometimes called procedural authorship. After 20+ years of museum automation, we are nearing the ability for the public to easily access the information in our databases. But are they finding meaning there? Given the fact that we can only afford to create specialized narratives for a limited subset of the museum information universe, this paper looks at existing examples of artistic practice to speculate on how it might be possible to use databases to tell meaningful stories about the objects museums collect."

    "year": "1999",
    "abstract": "As museums incorporate more virtual experience in their repertoire, they will need to plan new spaces, buildings, wings etc.. that provide the social and technical support for complex hybrid virtual/real activities. In addition to re-designing hardware and enhancing connectivity, museums will need strategies that provide for the flow between on site installations and virtual ones, between social and/or discussion areas and formal exhibit spaces, between stable permanent installations and quickly re-configurable presentation and activity areas. In the following article, I describe plans for a new building at Stanford University which is being designed by the Stanford Learning lab to specifically address these problems for education and cultural enterprises. The building will house anew center, the Wallenberg Global Learning Center (WGLC), which unites a group of international partners in projects that explore the intricacies of learning and culture in a global age. The building will feature new space and technical configurations that support complex, dynamically changing global collaborations, including fluid interchanges between formal and informal spaces, built- in building memories', and reconfigurable formats designed to facilitate complex virtual and on site experiences. Though intended for use on the campus, the building should help prototype new spaces being planned for museums. The design of the WGLC will reflect the SLL's belief that learning is a social activity, arising out of the rich personal relations between teachers and students, and between students and their peers. We want virtual environments to enhance and not reduce the social and active nature of learning. Technology is a double-faced sword: it can reduce the density of these connections or it can serve to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing between individuals from different backgrounds and to firmly embed learning in particular life experiences and environments. Our spaces will provide for a new syntheses of theory , practice, dialogue, and exploration by integrating distant and on-site experiences and by forming communities out of diverse and distributed participants."

    "year": "1999",
    "abstract": "We describe a set of initiatives which explore means to use the Internet as a positive social force to empower communities to create, capture and share cultural heritage through museum and K-12 partnerships. The Cultural Heritage Initiative for Community Outreach (CHICO) (http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/) at the University of Michigan (UM) School of Information has implemented an ongoing series of prototypes through which K-12/museum partnerships use the Internet as a vehicle to promote and enhance the on-site museum experience. The potential of the Internet to empower users to capture, share, and enhance K-12 learning is exemplified in a project in which local middle school students developed their own Kids Guide to a special exhibit of Monet paintings (http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/monet/). A related project enabled middle school students to learn about different styles of art in museum visits, communicate further with museum curators through a webboard, and create their own art works in the styles they had just learned about (http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Emerson). The potential of the Internet to provide contextual content is being explored to create awareness of different cultures and facilitate cross-disciplinary learning. A partnership between CHICO, the Smithsonian National Museum for the American Indian (NMAI), and Alaskan Yupik Indian communities was developed to showcase an NMAI exhibit on Yupik masks. In the course of this project, Yupik schools, Yupik community elders, and a leading scholar on Yupik culture came together in a cross-generational enterprise to capture content to place the mask exhibit in a broader cultural context and to enrich K-12 learning about the diversity of Native American culture. In addition to the website (http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Yupik/), a CD ROM provides cross-disciplinary context for the exhibit by linking it to environmental study of the Yupik geographical area. School children became active participants and communicated with each other on topics relating to the exhibit. Providing context useful to promote and contextualize museum resources and to maximize museum visit time was an objective of projects undertaken by CHICO and the UM Kelsey Museum of Archaeology (http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/mummy/) HREF=\"http://chico.si.umich.edu/kelsey/title.html\">http://chico.si.umich.edu/kelsey/title.html), and (http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Archives/amulets/home.html). For some repositories, where access to physical collections may be limited or even non-existent, the Internet can provide a vehicle for access and contextualization of content. CHICO websites developed for a Harlem Renaissance exhibit in partnership with the Schomburg Center for the Study of Black Culture (http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Harlem), and websites developed for a fragile quilt collection at and the Henry Ford Museum are examples. Another major initiative brought together K-12 teachers using primary materials in instruction, and museum education professionals in a workshop to explore how classroom teachers and museum educators can enrich learning through effective use of digital and on-site primary materials in museums, archives, and other cultural repositories. These are some of a larger set of initiatives undertaken by CHICO which use the Internet as a mechanism to broaden access to cultural heritage resources, to enhance appreciation for real-life exhibits, and to promote cross-cultural, cross-generational discourse and exchange."

    "abstract": "The National Museum of Science and Technology of Milan is the most important Science Museum in southern Europe. Its website (http://www.museoscienza.org/english), opened in January 1998, has rapidly achieved a good audience success. Key to this result was a promoting campaign based on three elements: 1. Diffusion of the URL: the website existence was pushed in three different ways: in the Museum, targeting the most natural audience, on the media (press and radio), trying to transform the Museum website into a news item interesting for the journalists, and on the Net, using search engines and directories not only to achieve visibility but also to identify websites most likely to be interested into linking the Museum. 2. Link - exchange campaign: we asked webmasters to support the Museum by adding our banner to their websites or personal home pages - our final goal was to create a sort of Virtual Community spread around the net, with the Museum website in the center of it. 3. Website stats analysis: every promoting operation was followed by detailed analysis of the access stats to verify the effect of the single move. Our main effort was to determine the \"quality\" of the audience, by a specially developed analyzing software. The paper explains in detail these three elements, together with data and visual examples of our promoting moves - the good ones and the bad ones as well. The relationship between promotion and actual results in term of quantity and quality of site visits is thoroughly reported; the data gathered are a valuable source for other museums involved in similar actions."

The most innovative aspect of our work is that we define design patterns [Gam95, Scw97] to represent design problems and design solutions, and compare the various sites in terms of the frequency and use of the various patterns. We distinguish among different categories of Web design patterns: structural, interaction, and lay-out patterns, and we use a design model - HDM (Hypermedia Design Model) [Gar93], to formulate design patterns in a clear and non ambiguous way. Finally, we suggest how to inspect the sites in a systematic way, using a list of abstract tasks which describe precisely what to do on the various constituents of a site [Gar98a, Gar98b] in order to discover the occurrence of the different patterns.

    "abstract": "Given the existence of a digital library, what software tools would be most efficient and effective in enhancing the educational value and usability of the collection?\" The George Bush Digital Video Library project will address this question by developing a speech-based digital video library together with a set of network-based interactive tools that extend beyond search and retrieval operations. The library will eventually contain 6000 hours of digitized speeches given by former President George Bush and their associated textual transcripts. The materials are being obtained in cooperation with the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum. The basic premise of this project is that digital libraries must offer more than advanced collection maintenance and retrieval services since the ultimate goal of a library, whether physical or digital, is to serve the needs of its patrons whose objectives are often not solely the retrieval of information artifacts. Patrons instead seek these artifacts in order to manipulate and combine them to produce new information artifacts. Thus, in addition to being a repository of information artifacts, a digital library should be an environment that supports the manipulation of these artifacts and the authoring and incorporation of new artifacts. The goal of this research is to extend the functionality of the digital library to allow researchers, educators, and st udents to peruse, compose, and publish knowledge artifacts (currently constituting synchronized mixed text and video hypermedia presentations and annotations) in the collection to meet their informational needs. Crucial to the realization of the project's objectives is the user interface. Drawing from current research as well as development experience with previous prototypes, this paper proposes and discusses a Web-based direct manipulation interface to the digital library. The interface represents a spatially oriented workspace consisting of objects of different data types such as queries, text, video, and presentations. The direct manipulation paradigm allows these objects to be positioned and visually altered by patrons to create both formal and informal information structures. The interface is designed to integrate the various tasks envisioned to be performed by a patron, which includes information retrieval and organization, as well as artifact authoring and publication. Patrons will be able to search the library for video clips and textual transcripts, integrate the desired information artifacts together with any annotations to dynamically form a synchronized mixed text and video hypermedia presentation through the material, and finally publish the presentation back into the digital library if desired."

We define the Internet as an information room, an architecture, where non-linear navigation has to be understood first. However, we find that the capabilities of nonlinear navigation structures are still being neglected. Designers and developers of multimedia are still heavily influenced by traditional concepts deriving from classical graphic design. An intelligent and functional graphic interface can substitute for the linear and naive iconography, which dominates the Internet and CD-ROM publishing today. The creation and design of the ZKM web-site was based on the development of content embedded into a clear and logical navigation framework that provides a user-friendly interface with short loading times. This required in-depth understanding of the nature and the public mission of the ZKM."

When the Finnish National Gallery launched its web pages in 1995, the Internet was still relatively new and future developments were hard to predict. As the use of the Internet continues to expand, the situation looks clearer: electronic communication has become an important and permanent part of museum work. The Finnish National Gallery is currently in the process of revising the style and structure of its web pages. In the first version of the web pages, emphasis was placed on the history of the Gallery and its collections. The overhaul aims to spruce up the visual appearance of the web pages, and to clarify their structure by presenting the different parts of the Gallery as distinct entities that complement one another. For example, the work of the Conservation Unit, generally unknown to ordinary visitors, is to be illustrated through words, images and animation. Similarly, the collection and work of the Central Art Archives will be presented in depth on the Internet. The revised web pages can be found at the old address (http://www.fng.fi), and they are available in Finnish, Swedish and English. The revised site makes use of the latest Internet specifications, including Cascading Style Sheets and HTML 4.0 (Hypertext Markup Language).

The School of Library and Information Sciences in cooperation with the School of Visual Arts received a grant from the federal Institute of Museum and Library services to build a collaborative program that includes a digital imaging laboratory and fellowships for students in a Certificate of Advanced Study Program. The work of the digital image manager includes the production of visual images, the creation and management of databases and the ability to use advanced network and information technologies to improve access to digital images and information. The program of study prepares individuals to work as digital image managers in museums, libraries, archives, and other information centers. The project provides a unique educational experience made possible by the cooperation between a museum and a university. Students digitize objects from the museum collection and build an image database that will be accessible on the Web. The experience includes the use of video-conference technologies to enhance collaboration between the museum and the university. Students communicate with the museum staff, work on images and database information simultaneously and share experiences immediately. By linking the digital image laboratory and the African American Museum, students have every opportunity to learn from museum professionals as well as from university professors. The project is a model for training professionals in the creation, use and management of digital images and may serve as a model of collaboration between museums and universities. In addition, the project assesses the impact resulting from improved access to a museum collection through the Web."

Until recently,out-reach museum educational activities were associated with traditional media delivery; brochures, kits and video, providing information for the pre- museum visit and an opportunity to take a little something back to the home or classroom after the visit. Internet delivery of educational material can add a further dimension - interactivity. While it is fairly simple to translate educational print and video material into the html environment, the real challenge for museum educators lies in their ability to create a link between the school and the museum, between student and student, from school to school and from the home to the school. The Ruth Youth Wing, the Education Department of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, has designed a new interactive school program based on the 3D virtual exhibition, 'The Light of the Menorah', a photo realistic 3D gallery tour, streamed at 15 frames per second over standard dial-up modems with embedded 3D-hyper links enabling students to interact with the movie. This is an adaptation of a major temporary exhibition at the Israel Museum, 'In the Light of the Menorah: Story of a Symbol' which traced the manifold incarnations and interpretations of the seven-branched candelabrum, from Biblical sacred object to national emblem, as represented in objects from the extensive Museum's collections of archaeology, Judaica, and the fine arts, and through icons from institutions world wide. This has offered an opportunity to devise new and exciting activities, incorporating the real time interactive component."

    "abstract": "The American Museum of Natural History was founded almost 130 years ago. It is one of the world's pre-eminent natural history museums, a leading scientific research institution, especially in the fields of systematic and evolutionary biology, vertebrate paleontology and anthropology. The Museum's founders envisioned an institution \"furnishing popular instruction and recreation\" and \"encouraging and developing the study of the Natural Sciences.\" Throughout its history, the Museum has developed and sustained an active education agenda with a full complement of programs and activities for learners of all ages and backgrounds, across a broad spectrum of scientific topics. This agenda includes thousands of class visits (more than 500,000 students a year); workshops and courses for thousands of teachers ( more than 10,000 a year); more than 200 hundred public programs (e.g., lectures, performances, film series, workshops) annually; and numerous programs designed for groups that traditionally have been under-represented in science, that are under-served by schools, or for which museums are not a regular destination (e.g., minorities, girls, and the disabled). Through exhibitions and programs, the Museum has served as a bridge between the scientific community and the lay public, educating and entertaining generations of New Yorkers and visitors to the City from across the nation and the globe. To better serve and educate its audiences, which are multilingual and come from highly diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, the Museum has recently completed a strategic planning process in which it reaffirmed its twin missions of science and education and planned for their further integration. The plan underlines the Museum's responsibility and commitment to serve as a platform for educating the public about science, the process of science, and scientific issues of pressing public concern. It emphasizes the strategic importance of partnerships and the use of technology, and heralds the National Center for Science Literacy, Education, and Technology as a vehicle for moving the Museum's educational activities beyond its walls. As the Museum approaches the new century, it is also developing dramatic new exhibition foci and resources. These comprise exhibition and programming relating to: 1) biodiversity, promoting an understanding of the range and variety of life on the planet, its importance to life on Earth, threats to its existence, and strategies for its sustainable development; 2) Earth and planetary sciences, promoting an understanding of the dynamic processes that shaped and continue to shape the planet; and 3) astrophysics, promoting an understanding of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planets. In all of these new exhibitions the focus is on the scientific enterprise-what we know (and don't know) and how we know it. The new halls and the efforts of the National Center will provide unparalleled resources for communicating science to the public, increasing science literacy not only at the Museum but around the country. About The National Center for Science Literacy, Education, and Technology: With its long tradition of excellence in research, the array of scientific resources on which it can draw ( including a collection of more than 32 million artifacts and specimens, its scientific staff of more than 200 men and women who go on more than 100 research expeditions a year), the impressive size of its audience, and its historic dedication to public education, the Museum is positioned to assume a significant new national role in advancing standards of scientific literacy nationwide. The National Center is advancing this objective by developing educational materials, programs, and activities that capture the scientific resources and spirit of the Museum, make science more accessible, and promote the teaching and learning of essential twenty-first-century skills. Its efforts are directed at audiences of all ages and in all places (homes, schools, libraries, planetaria, science centers, colleges and universities, and community-based organizations), and take advantage of the power of information and telecommunications technologies. New technologies present new challenges as well as opportunities. It is not enough to say that we must wire all classrooms to the Internet. What will students find when they get there? It is not enough to say that students can follow scientists on an expedition. How will it fit into the standards teachers are being asked to teach? It is not enough to say that we will connect children to real science and real scientists. How can these programs work so that children have that contact, but scientists can get their work done? It makes no sense to bring advanced technologies -such as the Internet, interactive television, and advanced image processing and simulation tools -to twenty-first-century classrooms if we continue to teach in nineteenth-century ways. In the first two years of operation we have  developed a middle school curriculum on Biodiversity (called Biodiversity Counts) that integrates print, hands-on outdoor activities, natural history drawing and online technology. Now being piloted in 115 schools in 39 states.  redesigned the Museum's Public web site,  developed a digital publishing system to enable people throughout the Museum to create their own websites that can connect to the Public Site  webcast a number of scientific conferences,  co-produced an interactive televised broadcast on the Mars landing, developed 'Bulletins' that update the science presented in the new halls,  created at least 20 web sites for targeted communities ( from 'lapware' for parents of young children to use with their pre-schoolers to an extensive site on Black Smokers, undersea volcanoes, targeted to high school earth science classes.  taken over a million people on online expeditions to the Gobi Desert, the Juan de Fuca ridge, Gabon, Bolivia, Siberia, and Australia. Some of these expeditions have been in partnership with Discovery Channel On Line, some have been first-person dispatched from the scientists themselves back to out web site. We are experimenting with targeting audiences, distribution mechanisms, business models to support our ongoing work, and interactivity. We are embarking on several major new projects that focus on developing online learning communities, including professional development of teachers and at least 3 other middle school science curricula. We propose to show some of the work we have done--warts and all. What we have learned, what we did well, what didn't work. More importantly we would like to discuss the kinds of issues we are trying to address--the problem as we posed it to ourselves. We hope this might be a contribution to the kinds of questions, all of our institutions are wrestling with. What's the Issue? Our big issue has been that the American Museum of Natural History is in a way a 'temple of evidence\". People come here to see real things--real dinosaurs, real meteorites, real totem poles. Our mandate is to take the resources beyond the walls, but all of these resources lose their \"Aha!\" quality when digitized and put on a 13 inch screen. Here is how we framed our challenge - how do we retain reality when we go virtual? There are at least two major categories of resources that we could tap into--ones that are not as apparent when you walk through the doors: our scientists and their work, and the affection and connection that the community feels for this place (this community includes not only the New York are, but is global through tourism, and certainly throughout the scientific community...we find that many scientists were inspired on a field trip here in their youth) . Going beyond the walls has come to mean going behind the scenes, designing experiences for visitors they couldn't have at the museum, and trying to figure out how to build learning communities online. The issues we are facing, dealing with--are issues we all face as educators, and museum educators."

    "abstract": "The Museum of the Person is a private institution founded in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1992. Its object consists in registering, preserving and transforming life stories into organized information. Currently, we count on about 700 stories, 2,000 photos and digitalized documents. The Museum of the Person is essentially a virtual Museum. Before the popularization of Internet, the Museum of the Person had been organizing information in multimedia databanks, and transforming the projects results in CD-ROM, publications and videos. The Museum of the Person is supported by projects that are developed to various companies and institutions in Brazil. The popularization of Internet in Brazil enabled the Museum of the Person to fulfill its vocation, that is, to allow all persons (even if currently only those with access to the Web) to register their life stories and/or the stories of relatives (this includes photobiographies, depositions, homages, etc.). At the same time, the Museum of the Person makes available - through the site - its assets for reference and school, academic and professional researches. Currently, we are unifying all our assets in a databank in the MS SQL Server, with reference through the Index Server. It is important to point out that the assets reference, as well as the sending of stories, is an institutional service of the Museum of the Person, absolutely free of charge. Our presentation intends to report the development and the current work status of the Museum of the Person in the Web. We will emphasize how the Web solidified the existence of the Museum of the Person as an essentially virtual institution. We will also describe the uses made by the public of the possibilities offered by our site."

Photographer/historian Arno Gisinger and webmaster/historian Niko Hofinger tried to throw a bridge to the actual virtual reality enthusiasm by realizing the homepage of the Innsbruck giant panoramic painting \"Die Schlacht am Bergisel 1809\" with quicktime vr and more than 100 explaining pages about the panorama phenomenon. On the European cyclorama society meeting in November 1998, a network of the virtual reality dinosaurs will be established and realized by Gisinger and Hofinger. challenge of this enterprise will be to bring the cycloramas out of their antiquated image back to the place they deserve as important cultural heritage of Europe. My speech will cover the historical background of antique virtual reality as well as the presentation of this unique cooperation of cycloramas in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland."

    "year": "1999",
    "abstract": "In the last quarter of the 3rd century AD, a Gallo-Roman trading vessel caught fire and sank near to the shore of an island 28 miles west of mainland Gaul. The most technologically advanced thing about the vessel seems to have been the cast bronze bearings of its bilge pumps and yet its influence reached down the ages and helped to propel Guernsey Museum on to the World Wide Web. This talk will consider the circumstances behind this remarkable scenario and the links it has helped to forge with our 20th century European partners, who invited us to join them in constructing an Internet database of ancient shipwrecks. The database project was christened NAVIS and received EU approval in 1996, for a two-year programme to finish at the end of 1998. The resultant web site will go live early in 1999 and the main part of this presentation will examine the scope and development of the project, together with the benefits to the participants themselves."

    "abstract": "Museums and exhibition halls have come on a long way since they were simply places which displayed works of art and documented cultural topics. Nowadays, the activities of many such institutions go far beyond displaying and arranging objects of cultural interest. A variety of activities designed to convey information are put on to tie in with exhibitions of collections or temporary exhibitions and it is increasingly common for wide-ranging programmes of events to be provided alongside the exhibitions. Since over the last four years many museums have discovered the Internet as a \"gateway to the world\", a platform for presenting information and carrying out research, the temptation is to exploit the multimedia capabilities of the Internet in a way which has otherwise been reserved for the medium of television: \"live Web broadcasting\". The possibilities for appearing on the Internet as a \"TV station\", and the staff and finances required to achieve this, are presented in three live Webcasts (cybercasts, live broadcasts), produced by the Kunsthalle last year, followed by an overview of the latest video streaming technology currently available. Although the basic principles of this technology are straightforward to describe, a professional live broadcast is very labour and cost-intensive. Up to a dozen employees were involved in organising each of these events, in order to reach an \"Internet audience\" of between 250 and 1000 people. Without the cooperation and commitment or sponsorship involvement of participating companies (service providers), it would not have been possible to broadcast these events on the Internet. Nevertheless, the Kunsthalle will endeavour to repeat some of these live Web broadcasts in 1999 - initial negotiations are already underway."

A brief historical overview of the evolution of the web site will set the backdrop for exploring the distributed national collections of the Australian museums. Acting a gateway or metacenter for museums on-line collections the AMOL web has also become a focus for a revitalized community network that is flourishing across the country. The AMOL web has recently undergone major redesign and this paper will include discussion of the difficulties of inherited architecture and the process of morphogenesis. The new design seeks to reinterpret the AMOL web as a \"cabinet of wonder\" for museum professionals, community users and researchers. This paper will present some of the new projects that have been developed on the web that will be of interest to an international museums community."

    "year": "1999",
    "abstract": "Beginning in late 1995, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum launched an effort to create an interactive student resource for use by secondary school teachers and their students. A guiding idea was to offer both a useful resource to students and to demonstrate to teachers, by example, what the Museum viewed as effective teaching methods. In order to reach the greatest number of schools at the least cost, the project was built as a web site. In addition to presenting a variety of historic materials from the museum's collections, the web site provided opportunities for students to share ideas and ask questions among themselves, with their teachers, and with Museum staff. Over the course of two years, three branches of the Museum worked together to develop the design and interface, determine and collect content, and prepare it for web publication. In a pilot project the site was tested at seven schools across the country. Three members of the creative team that developed and tested this website will share information about their experiences working on this project. They will address the following topics, discussing both continuing problems and creative solutions developed along the way. 1. Interface design: What are potential limitations (the practicalities of computers capabilities in the school classroom/connectivity)? What is appropriate for serious content? How do you present linear history in a multi-pathed environment? What obstacles does one encounter in moving from print to electronic media? How can the interface engage without being only entertaining? 2. Interdepartmental Teambuilding: Collections, Historians, Graphics, Learning Center, Education, Technology. Project management. 3. Creating the site: The Development Process Form vs. Function. Design and implementation of the messaging functions. 4. On-line Activities: Designing on-line projects to elicit critical thinking about historic source materials, and exploring the challenges of learning in a non-linear environment. 5. The Educational Pilot: Testing the Product. Creating a classroom-friendly educational model for the web. 6. The Future: Achievements, Lessons learned, Continuing Problems with technology, history, and education -- who has the final word? Copyright, historical integrity, interactivity, and other \"problems\" that museums encounter when designing publications for the on-line community."

GEM's goal is to provide efficient and effective access to collections of educational materials distributed across the Internet, including those available from museum web sites. It has long been recognized that traditional searching technologies do not meet the needs of users, particularly when they are searching for materials in distributed collections, such as those found on the Internet. GEM solves this resource discovery problem through the use of meta-data. Based on research on how teachers look for educational resources, GEM developed a set of 23 elements, using the Dublin Core as a base referent. Software developed by GEM allows users to create meta-data records that describe and point to the education resources. These records are then collected together at a central location, forming The Gateway . By searching or browsing this catalog of meta-data records, educators can find resources more efficiently and with more precision."

Digital environments offer great potential for the enhancement of collaborative aspects of both art creation and art exploration. However, the current notion of a digital environment is vague and most often associated with the traditional concepts of computer use. Thus, the goal of this paper is twofold: a) to present an analysis of the characteristics of digital environments, and b) to suggest their potential uses in the building of collaborative pedagogical procedures for the digital medium."

    "abstract": "The main question is not how can we transfer the content of our database management systems to our colleagues or visitors? The main question is how can we learn again to communicate together and with the following generations? This is one of the main tasks of museum policy at the beginning of the 21st century. But there are a lot of other suggestions: What is the real benefit of the using multimedia technology and database management systems in museums in proportion to the expenditure? How does computer technology engage the objects and the museum? How does the visitor handle the experience of electronic reproductions and originals? What about the aura of the original? When becomes the reproduction of a reproduction into an original again? How interactive is the interactivity really? Do the registrars, visitors know something about the change of perception using computer technology in the museums? The relation between virtuality and reality has changed. The question of the medium is rarely of interest nowadays. Interactivity can produce a specific relation to reality. Traditional categories are no longer valid, even though they continue to exist. Other special fields, such as genetic engineering, cybernetics, artificial intelligence, cyberspace, as well as ecology, sociology and politics are introduced. The traditional understanding of chronology disappears. Technological development and the media combine past, presence and future. The world becomes a museum. Nowadays, one of the main tasks of the museum is to critically deal with the possibilities of electronic reproductions. The meaning and importance of museums are changing in the age of digital revolution. The museum of the 21st century will have to find his position in the community, his specific digital corporate identity, to be a constructive counterpart to the deluge of reproductive media images, and it will also have to consider itself an interactive transmitter actively influencing the opening of electronic \"elbow spaces\" and the creation of new visual codes. With the Invisible Person - an interactive virtual environment, the Technisches Museum Wien will create a virtual moderator, a guide through the world of new visual codes, of reproductional reproductions, of originals, aura and interactivity. Based on the concept of the ALIVE project, developed at the MIT Media Lab, future visitors of the Technisches Museum Wien will be able to interact with an artificial intelligence object, named the Invisible Person, based on an immersive virtual environment. That means, without any additional devices, the visitor will be able to communicate with the artificial life form through gesture elements (a later step is to incorporate audio) over a back projection wall which acts as a virtual mirror. The complete scene will be generated on a SGI machine in real-time in a daylight environment. After a testing period in the museum, we want to bring the Invisible Person and the experiences we've made with him on the web."

    "abstract": "The National Museums of Kenya (NMK), established in 1910 as a repository of natural history specimens, has grown to become one of the foremost cultural and research institutions in Africa. Its offices at the Nairobi headquarters boast over twenty active research departments, ranging from Archaeology to Invertebrate Zoology to Palaeontology. It also comprises the Institute of Primate Research, traditional craft training centres, Old Town conservation offices, sixteen regional museums situated throughout the country, and hundreds of sites and monuments of historical, archaeological and/or architectural interest. There are also active Education Departments which strive to maintain an exciting curriculum of museum visits, competitions and other educational programmes which are offered to public and private schools country-wide. Yet despite these obvious achievements, and the trend towards modernisation, the NMK has until recently lagged behind in using Information Technology (IT) for developing new museum programmes. It has consistently viewed IT as a means of data management for such mundane purposes as personnel and payroll records. Nonetheless, the NMK has, against all the odds and with very limited human and financial resources, created and developed a web site , which promises to be a source of vital information for students, scientists, educators, and even potential tourists. At present, the site offers information on the regional museums, sites and monuments, research and public programme departments, activities and events. The NMK has seen the potential - and is building the capacity - to develop it further to include searchable scientific databases, collections on-line, and virtual tours. Of greater importance is the role that the NMK can play in developing a Web site that can play a major role in the promotion of national heritage - both natural and cultural. That is, of course, if it can tackle the more technical challenges of connectivity. So the question is: How do African museums tackle the IT challenges facing them as they enter the 21st century? How can we forge and foster not only North-South but also South-South relations through collaborative ventures, and through better use of the World Wide Web? How do we ensure that we are not left behind as our counterparts in the North race ahead at lighting speed?"

    "abstract": "3D interactive interfaces for museum Web sites have sometimes been advocated, but never became really popular. Several reasons have contributed to this lack of success: lack of (serious) 3D for low-medium range machines; cost of development; poor visual quality (crucial for museum applications); lack of real added value (why should I do it?). As matter of fact \"traditional\", 2D, multimedia sites is what is currently available. New technical developments, such as VRML (or 3DJAVA, in the near future), are slowly changing the situation: cost is not an issue anymore; the technical quality is becoming reasonable. Still, as it was shown also at the 98 version of this conference, there is still a lack of real motivations to go 3D (in an interactive way). In this paper we argue that, cooperative visit could add a decisive motivation. Most of the visitors don't go by themselves to \"real\" museum; they go with friends (or guide), they talk to each other, they teach (or listen to), they point to exhibits, they follow each other, etc. etc. So there is a complex human interaction, making the experience much more rewarding. The main point of the paper is that adding the possibility of having several \"virtual\" visitors visiting (from different locations) the same machine, interacting each other, as they do in the real word, can make a virtual visit much more interesting and rewarding. The paper will discuss a prototype developed using a special technique developed at the HOC laboratory of the Politecnico of Milan: VRML-TALK. VRML-Talk is an authoring technique which allows to develop custom 3D environments in which actions and situations can be shared throughout a computer-based network. The VRML-Talk makes use of standard web-based Internet/Intranet technology. It is composed of a VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) graphical engine and a Java-based TCP/IP (the Internet Protocol) communication layer. The two elements are executed together from a single web page which can be browsed with a standard Internet browser such as Netscape. A central server takes care of distributing the events and managing the connections to the cooperative virtual environments. The server application is also written in Java, and can be run on any kind of platform supporting a Java Virtual Machine. When the system is active every single action performed by the user of a 3D virtual world is sent to the server, which broadcasts the event to the other clients, so that the action is propagated to all the other users. Each user can \"see\" the position of the other users, being represented by avatars. Also a user may look at a world \"through the eyes\" of an other user. The paper will be presented by demonstrating the effectiveness and the appeal of a demonstrator, that uses VRML-Talk in the context of a (fictitious)museum site. In other words a cooperative visit of several user to the same site will be shown.

    "abstract": "This paper begins by presenting and discussing the distinction between record-oriented and pattern-oriented search. Examples of record-oriented (or item-oriented) questions include: \"What (or how many, etc.) glass items made prior to 100 A.D. do we have in our collection?\" and \"How many paintings featuring dogs do we have that were painted during the 19th century, and who painted them?\". Standard database systems are well suited to answering such questions, based on the data in, e.g., a collections management system. Examples of pattern-oriented questions include: \"How does the (apparent) production of glass objects vary over time between 400 B.C. and 100 A.D.?\" and \"What other animals are present in paintings with dogs (painted during the 19th century and in our collection)?\". Standard database systems are not well suited to answering these sorts of questions (and pattern-oriented questions in general), even though the basic data is properly stored in them. To answer pattern-oriented questions it is the accepted solution to transform the underlying (relational) data to what is called the data cube or cross-tabulation form (there are other forms as well). We discuss how this can be done for non-numeric data, such as are found widely in museum collections and archives. Further we discuss and demonstrate two distinct, but related, approaches to exploring for patterns in such cross-tabulated museum data. The two approaches have been implemented as the prototype systems Homer and MOTC. (For pointers, see Kimbrough's home page, http://grace.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/, or contact him directly.) We conclude by discussing initial experimental evidence indicating that these approaches are indeed effective in helping people find answers to their pattern-oriented questions of museum and archive collections."

    "year": "1999",
    "abstract": "The user access to a web interface of a museum application can have many motivations. There are various types of users, who want to perform various tasks, in various contexts, that can access to the same web site. Thus it is important to have user interfaces able to adapt to these different user requirements to facilitate the accomplishment of the desired goals. In the paper we want to discuss different techniques to design such adaptable interfaces for museum web sites and provide examples of applications of some of them by considering the type of impact that they can have in a web interface for the Marble Museum located in Carrara (Italy). Currently in the application for the Marble Museum, at the beginning the user can select a visitor profile (e.g. expert, art-student or tourist), and during the virtual visit the user has the opportunity to change this profile. Thus the system is adaptable because the user can modify the profile parameter and the system changes its behaviour accordingly. Adaptation can occur at three levels: Presentation, where it is possible to differentiate the type of media, the layout, the attributes of the perceivable elements (such as font type and size) depending on the type of access; Information, where the information content can be changed, sometime drastically, even if related to the same topic, depending on the type of user and the use foreseen; Navigation, where different links are provided, in some cases in different locations and with different appearance. Adaptation can be done manually by users who explicitly indicate some parameters useful for understanding their needs or it can be done automatically by the system (in this case many authors define the interface as adaptive). Generally speaking, user models can be static or dynamic. In static models, user knowledge is represented as 'topic-value' pairs but the values are not completely independent. The user can be assigned to one or more stereotypes (for example novice - intermediate - expert). Each stereotype is characterised by a fixed set of pairs 'topic-value' and the user assigned to a stereotype inherits all these properties. This modelling is reliable enough and works well for a system that needs to adapt to different classes of users. In the dynamic model for each domain model topic there is some estimation of how well the user is familiar with this topic and this estimation takes into account the history of previous accesses to the application. In dynamic modelling it is possible to measure user knowledge with more flexibility. The static models are simpler than dynamic modelling, but less powerful. Good results can be achieved by combining stereotype and overlay modelling. One possible way to combine these two techniques: static modelling is used to determine the class of the user and to assign initial values for the dynamic model. Then dynamic modelling is used to keep the model updated."

    "abstract": "Although the past few years have witnessed a proliferation of widely varying museum presentations on the WWW, research collections with few exceptions remain an under-utilized resource resulting in lack of access to in-depth material for subject experts, novice learners and everyone in between. Results of a user-centered evaluation of an experimental hypermedia prototype, based on The Pickwick Papers collection at the Dickens House Museum, London and designed for literary researchers, have led to the derivation of a generic model of a user-interface that can, so far: 1) facilitate access to otherwise unavailable materials, 2) support heterogeneous information needs, and 3) provide a design framework as an aid to development of literary research collections for the Web. The issues discussed concern user suggestions for levels of system content, screen design and navigational routes as well as a much-needed separate interface for novice users. The latter, which consists of a separate layer of introductory-level content , can support subject novices as well as other researchers who lack basic foundation in one subject area(s) whilst possessing proficiency in another(s). Illustrative examples emphasize design issues of indexing and hypertext linking, authored and reproduced text, image presentation and documentation, as well as special problems of 19th C. text presentations."

    "year": "1999",
    "abstract": "The Museum of Science, like many other institutions, jumped into the web business several years ago and launched a web site without a long-range plan or a dedicated web staff. Indeed, the institution's site was created as an afterthought to a grant-funded project. Part of the Museum's mission was to showcase new technologies, so in 1995 building a web site seemed a logical move that wouldn't require much time or effort. Now after four years of slow, unmanaged growth we have a new issue facing us - an identity crisis. Just what is the purpose of the site? The cross-divisional steering committee, charged with overseeing the site, spent the better part of a year trying to answer that question. Our examination of the site\\'s mission, both real and perceived, its audiences, and its potential to further the institution\\'s goals was an often-painful, but rewarding, experience that has had tremendous positive influence on our web efforts. The paper explores and explains some of the results of long months of discussion, brainstorming, and argument. The title for the paper is \\'So we\\'ve got a web site, now what?\\' and chronicles our efforts to bring the web into the institution\\'s day-to-day operations as well as distribute the process of web content generation. A constant tension in our web efforts has been the perception that the web is somebody else\\'s concern. Our small web staff is busy just trying to keep the current site running, let alone generate new content, so we have tried to minimize the burden of getting information onto the site by building processes to manage information inside the Museum and placing some of the burden on the content creators themselves. This paper is aimed at museums which have already launched their first-generation web sites and are grappling with the unglamorous but vital issues of maintenance, life-span of digital content (when is a web resource old?), ever-increasing demand for web content, and penetration of web technologies into other aspects of the institution (in intranets, on the exhibit halls, etc...)"

Sharing an interest in expanding public access to their institutions, the three partners have designed a web site that expands and enriches the educational resources available to young people, their families, and their teachers. Based upon a discovery model of learning, and driven by visual imagery, the site has inspired three cultural institutions to invent new software, and to look at issues of visual and research literacy in new ways. Recently awarded a two year National Leadership Grant by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Brooklyn Expedition has already created two thematic expeditions; one that explores structures (from buildings to skeletons to structures of information) and another that explores artifacts from Latin America. A third module will focus on the history and culture of Brooklyn, and will be created in cooperation with a team of teenagers. Additionally, an ongoing evaluation conducted by staff from the Center for Children and Technology will be used to track use of the site, its effectiveness as an educational tool and to inform decisions about changes and improvements of the site as it evolves over several years."

Re-examining digital material cataloged in these types of systems for the purpose of reaching broader audiences is the subject of this paper. It will encompass the design mechanisms that The American Museum of Natural History's Anthropology Department uses to deliver primary source material. Traditionally, curators would package a small subset of their collections for public consumption in the form of temporary and permanent exhibits. Electronic delivery of the same collection allows researchers and the general public the ability to create their own museum experience and open new interpretations of the collections. In order to create a public access web site we began the process by identifying our audiences as well as the best way to represent electronic collection data. With the extensive possibilities of interface design and database robustness, re-purposing source material becomes possible. Using the same criteria for designing both the research and public web sites was not practical, because the research site requires considerable expertise in the subject matter."

Accessed through a secured course Web site, students explore the high-quality digital images with a partner at in-class workstations as well as independently at remote locations. Replacing slide reproductions with the course Web site and full AMICO catalogue has created an active learning environment that motivates students to visit on-line library databases and thereby enhances their acquisition of basic knowledge and research skills.

New tools permit museum users to design their own path through selected objects and to incorporate museum pieces into their own web-based publications. But what if the museum began to collect items that were not in its physical collection? What if the user-contributed input became part of the museum's virtual collection? Native American materials are widely distributed in private collections and public museums, both in Native controlled or reservation museums and cultural centers and in non-Native facilities. Based on our experience with Navajo artifacts, we've developed a virtual museum prototype that incorporates objects from diverse sources. We will discuss a model that encourages museums to consider the role of ethnic communities, incorporation of multi-generational voices, and local or tribal member input into exhibit and collection development. During our presentation we will reference other projects that are dealing with issues of standardization and multi-institutional collaboration that will further inform future projects.

    "abstract": "In developing online museum resources, much of the focus is on creating compelling content -and rightly so. However, appealing graphics and thoughtful navigation schemes can go a long way toward improving the user's experience. Too many sites with great content fall flat when it comes to graphics, diminishing their impact for visitors or even worse, turning them away in the first place. Also, sites without clear navigation can leave visitors frustrated and feeling lost. What makes good design and sensible navigation? The answer is complex and subjective, but some approaches are more effective than others. Developing the graphics in concert with the content (or, at the very least, developing a deep understanding of the content) is vital to creating an integrated site. Letting the subject matter of the site \"decide\" the design and, in some cases, assist in the development of the navigation scheme, seems to be effective. Also, understanding how the site will be used can further refine it's look and help define it's navigation. Finally, attention to detail, along with adherence to the rigorous technical limitations of the Web, must be addressed in developing sites that incorporate effective design and navigation schemes.

In addition, museum@online wants to promote contacts between schools, museums and art and cultural institutions on an international basis. The \"New Media\" offer young people the possibility of a new and interesting encounter with museums as well as art and cultural institutions beyond national boundaries. During the school year 1997/98 more than 60 projects were submitted, 41 finished their work in June 1998; 6 different categories of museum@online-awards were defined by the jury. All the projects and also the workshops are well documented on the homepage. In the current school year 1998/99 the project has been extended to 3 different streams (expecting 100 projects); beneath the classical projects of museum@online one additional project is focussing the integration of videospots for cultural use and the second one named VIA-Virtual Albertina is connected to an exhibition dedicated to Francesco Borromini and the Baroque Age (see: http://www.borromini.at) in the year 2000 (Rome and Vienna)."

Identifying these changes -- never an easy task -- was, for McLuhan, the first step towards understanding them. The Neon Paintbrush will first explore the ways in which \"looking\" has always been different from \"seeing\" and how \"seeing,\" in turn, helps create visual culture. Using examples from the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery, the paper will move on to show the dramatic changes new technologies have brought to visual cultures throughout the world, confirming McLuhan's theory of the relationship between technological and cultural change. Moving on to the present, the paper will explore the changes that the World Wide Web is bringing to all kinds of visual culture. It will look at such phenomena as pirate museums, web-based art, the introduction of esoteric imagery, such as NASA photographs, into public life, and personal image archives on the web. It will explore how the web is altering such image-text cultures as television and newspaper journalism, biological research, museum presentations, historiography, and even the texts and images of private life.

    "abstract": "With the spread of fast computers and high bandwidth, the Internet is moving beyond text and still images, becoming an avenue for audio and video content. Increasingly sophisticated software enables live events to be Webcast at a relatively low cost; almost anything you can put in front of a camera or a microphone can be Webcast to the world. Nonprofit educational institutions such as museums can now enter the broadcasting fray. But what does it mean for a museum to become a Webcast content producer? Is television a model that museums should imitate? Does the web medium enable new and different kinds of interaction with the audience? Webcasting offers many new possibilities: o Live events can be archived online for later viewing. o Other forms of Web content can prepare audiences for the live event, creating a deeper experience. o E-mail and live chat can offer Web audiences a way to interact with museum staff during a broadcast. o All forms of content produced can be combined after the event to create a valuable Web resource, which offers value to web visitors long after the event o Live events can draw large audiences to a Web site, introducing them to other content areas. In the past two years, the Exploratorium has built an on-floor Webcast production studio, and has embarked on a program of Webcasts. Some were simple broadcasts of events on the museum floor, such as Iron Science Teacher, in which teachers built science demonstrations in the shop and presented them to the museum audience. Others were complex events like Solar Eclipse: Stories from the Path of Totality, in which the museum staff covered a total solar eclipse on the island of Aruba, bringing live video to the museum audience and then Webcasting both feeds into a Webcast out to an internet audience. By looking at the Exploratorium's experience over the past several years, this paper will examine some of the possibilities and pitfalls of this new hybrid medium.

Other educational activities can be built around it in the longer-term, from conferencing to joint projects. At an institutional level, the project can be seen as a first step in exploring the extent to which the nature and of the museum itself can be reinvented. The museum's educational users are encouraged to reflect on the museum and its subject matter and to restructure and reinterpret it for easy public access. Potentially this could lead to establishing longer-term relationships between the museum and many of its users. It should also result in the creation of more, and different, perspectives than could ever be achieved by the staff of the alone. Clearly this raises significant issues of institutional authority."

The Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange Format (SAMI) is intended as a way to provide closed captioning and audio description to multi-media materials. It does that. But, like so many tools developed to provide accessibility (ramps, curb cuts, volume controls in phones, comfortable spaces) the SAMI conventions turn out to be remarkably valuable for other purposes -- making simple multi-media presentations, providing multiple language support for your site, adding transcripts to video materials, and quite a bit more. The best thing about it is that while it uses some sophisticated web techniques, it is very easy to use. This session will offer enough of a look at the features that go into developing SAMI files so that you'll be able to make your own, some examples of swell tricks that can be done with SAMI when used with dynamic HTML, and some thoughts on an exciting new approach to presenting materials on the web.

While they are at their workshop, the sponsoring teachers (who may be meeting online friends for the first time) will take a customized all day tour of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Walker Art Center and The Frederick R. Weisman museum."

    "abstract": "Several museums in North Portugal agreed to join efforts to promote their activities among local communities, using interactive and multimedia technologies under the project GEIRA. Traditional Web approaches provide a general purpose environment to describe the main goals and activities of the museums together with some form of a catalogue containing the more relevant art objects in the museums. This approach requires a move towards a more aggressive appeal to invite (young) net surfers to enjoy repeated visits to the same museum site. Curators know how to attract the public to their museums; similar techniques are being applied to the Web, with further refinements.   A short presentation of some of these techniques and how they are being designed and implemented in North Portugal is the main topic of this communication; it includes the use of temporary exhibitions - 3D virtualization of real ones, virtual-only exhibitions, tales of objects, animated guided tours - through a theme, through space, through the time - and educational outreaches - school teacher's guides according to the age levels, pre- and post-quizzes, video clips on the Web showing the children reactions during the previous visit, room for the children to creatively express, and share on the Web, their feelings and ideas."

The primary goal of this project is to make available electronically the rich and diverse archival resources housed at the MHSO to students and teachers engaged in multicultural education and social studies. Using multimedia presentations of historical case studies, life histories, and cultural resources of the MHSO, the project will help teachers bring diversity alive in the classroom. The use of the collaborative tools of the World-Wide Web and classroom projects will help students and teachers create a classroom atmosphere in which local family, ethnic and immigration history can come together as Canadian history. Students are not only encouraged to use the resources but also contribute to the growing archive of living and shared histories. The project will be designed to achieve specific learning outcomes, and will provide opportunities for students to work together and learn from one another across institutional and cultural boundaries. Finally, the project also provides the opportunity for evaluating the effective means of integrating electronic resources and telecommunication tools into the curriculum."

    "abstract": "BABEL is a project aiming to create a network of Museums and Libraries in Spain, compatible being with the European initiatives, to make possible a teleconsult of their databases either from the Internet or from any public network point with access segment to the Internet. The teleconsult system must be based on a common manual, but respecting heterogeneities, particularities, and personalizations of the object registration cards resident being in the different Museums and Libraries (may be also at the level of different Departments of every Museum or Library). BABEL is a capitalization of results coming from projects sponsored by the European Commission, and the idea is to extend a network as much as possible by means of incorporating associate members to BABEL. These associate members may be information providers and users simultaneously, or only users. Another objective is the creation of a common information point to enter the Culture Spanish network (PIC) called Virtual Museum and Virtual Library. The user can navigate through descriptors resident being in this PIC, and then decide which databases are to be consulted. Normalization of a few fields must be agreed to make it possible the navigation in this PIC, but the personalization of the registration cards is kept in the different databases belonging to the Museums and Libraries. The participation of selected sponsors is crucial for the establishment of the PIC and for ensuring postproject actions to keep the BABEL fundamentals. BABEL is in line with the preparation of Museums and Libraries for its new role of service providers, converging with initiatives such as the Memorandum of Understanding launched by the European Commission."

The Revelation platform will enable pioneering new models of communication, a quantum leap beyond the present Internet facilities, providing a leading edge resource for electronic publication, network technology and computer-assisted consultation, collaboration and distance learning. The first pilot project for Revelation is already under way. The Hunterian Museum with the Department of Computing Science are developing a fully interactive online course in Hominid Evolution for delivery to the UK schools science curriculum, and, with the collaboration of the Smithsonian Institution, the US/Canadian K-12 curriculum. Initially we employ QuickTime Virtual Reality and 3-D modelling techniques to present on screen rotational and morphing images of a range of hominid skulls in the Hunterian collections, and incorporating computer based techniques developed in the University's Department of Forensic Medicine, Facial Identification Centre, to reconstruct the facial features of a selection of these early hominids. We are developing multi-camera photogrammetric techniques to enable rapid and economic capture of 3-D models precise enough for diagnostic measurement. The repository will be organised to hold a wide range of source data and individual progress data concerning interpretation of 3-D rendered models. The interface for students and teachers will allow access and analysis of this data. We will explore how best to organise and guide their use of this information and to enable efficient support of remote learners in groups as well as individual use. This depends heavily on Java to avoid requirements for sophisticated computing skills in our users and the schools."

    "abstract": "Museums, particularly in the cultural sector, are institutions of preservation. By and large their mission is not to lead culture but to preserve, understand, and educate about it. Will these and other bedrock functions be upgraded for the Net age--what Steven Johnson calls the \"interface culture\"--or are museums in danger of losing their cultural franchise to other more innovative, useful, or engaging enterprises, whether they be virtual organizations or entertainment conglomerates? This paper will look at examples of working with artists on the Web and curating \"Web art\" to see how these map to traditional notions of museum functions and whether they suggest new strategies for dealing in more innovative, useful, and engaging ways with traditional works of art in a Net environment. Specifically, I will discuss my experience curating the Walker Art Center's virtual \"Gallery 9\"; our attempts to do more than present information about the work of artists such as Joseph Beuys, Mark Luyten, and Diana Thater; and experiments in the presentation of our permanent collection using QTVR and VRML ( - January 98). I will also present examples of practices at other institutions--virtual or otherwise--that I think are innovative, useful, or engaging efforts to present web art and art on the web. If the goal is to compete effectively in the radically shifting cultural environment without losing the soul of the museum, the question remains how to do so. I believe that contemporary artists and \"interfacers\" (Johnson) have much to teach even museums about relevant possibilities of a new medium in a changing society."

    "abstract": "This paper is based on the experience of Program Geira with the collaboration of the Art Gallery from Museu Nogueira da Silva in Portugal. Providing access through the Internet to a 3D environment to the Art Gallery is just one of the three major components of this project. The first provides a 3D interactive editor for the gallery's staff to help them previewing the disposition of the art objects in the gallery. With the help of the editor the gallery's staff can arrange not only the art objects, but also the lighting, sound, and other effects. A second component brings the 3D virtual exhibition to the Web, with simultaneous openings for the real and virtual exhibitions. The Web exhibition will attempt to resemble as much as possible the real exhibition, including the lighting and sound conditions according to the current time and weather, taking into account bandwidth limitations. The third component of this project is the boldest: an interactive gallery simulator for the Web which provides net surfers the possibility to create their own exhibition. With this simulator the net surfer will be able select the desired art object's amongst a selection from the gallery and their position The lighting conditions can also be adjusted including the number of lights, their position, orientation and intensity. Sound is also contemplated providing the user with the ability to change the environmental music and the speakers' position. The exhibitions created with this simulator can then be submitted through the Web to the gallery for appreciation bringing the gallery closer to the community. Furthermore, this component will allow the Art Gallery of Museu Nogueira da Silva to open an \"Exhibition Designer\" competition for net surfers in which they would submit their own gallery, with the best submitted virtual gallery being replicated as a real exhibition."

The paper describes a novel manner of looking at museum exhibitions that can lead to the next generation of online exhibition design, based on the premises that an effective exhibition: is not an encyclopedia; it is a choreography of sight, sound, and thought. is alive and encourages exploration; it responds differently to different viewers. If a visitor does not interact with the material, the exhibition acts autonomously to bring an array of images and sounds to the viewer's attention. If the visitor explores, the exhibition responds accordingly. is dynamic. The very act of viewing the exhibition changes what is on display. Each time a person visits, he or she has a different experience. is communal. In the same way that a physical exhibition is a public experience, an effective online exhibition builds community. Visitors know that others are taking part in the exhibition and can choose to interact. These communications become part of the exhibition as it develops a life of its own. is a seamless environment that encourages exploration at a number of levels: visually, aurally, intellectually, and emotionally."

    "abstract": "Inspired by the Exploratorium, the Bristol Exploratory pioneered hands-on science in Britain. At the time this was the only interactive kind of public education about science. Of course, on television BBC Science in London and the BBC Natural History Unit based in Bristol lead the world in serious science and nature programmes, but theirs were all passive entertainment. There were few links with traditional museums. Now, with media convergence, interactivity is coming to Bristol in a big way. In Science World, the Exploratory is embracing multimedia, and in Wildscreen World, an electronic ARKive will make footage of endangered species available throughout the world. Media convergence will turn both traditional television and traditional education upside down by linking the world and by giving people real choice through interactivity. But how will this affect museums and science centres? Will there be any point in coming to buildings? Will an on-line virtual world do just as well? I shall suggest that a combination of real and virtual worlds will be extremely powerful educationally. If museums keep ahead of the frontier and recognise what they are good at, they will be the jam in the sandwich: the sweet emotional experience which makes the intellectual bread digestible! But it is not good enough just to tack web sites onto museums and add internet cafes to science centres. I shall attempt to present examples of combinations of real science, hands-on exhibits and on-line and off-line interactive multimedia which are only just now becoming possible."

By creating structures which embed the visit itself into an elecronic web of resources, community connections, discussions, and activities, the museum can create a personalized and long-lasting relationship with the individual visitor. The visitor can 'own' a personal portfolio that connects her or him with the on-going activities of the museum, and also enables her/him to develop a personally inflected store of experiences and information. The msueum can create special events reaching from the museum out into the world, and fine-tuned to the needs of specific visitors."

If, at the beginning, web sites had very simple structures, now they are becoming more and more ambitious, comprehensive and, therefore, complex. For this reason usability becomes important, and its evaluation can not be neglected. This paper presents a systematic approach to usability evaluation of museum web sites, which specializes a more general methodology, named SUE. The heart of the methodology is a combination of inspection (where experts evaluators examine the application), and empirical testing (where a sample of end-user experimentally use the application). Characteristics also include the use of a model (to describe the application), of abstract tasks (to guide the inspection activities), and of concrete tasks (to guide the empirical testing). In this paper a brief description of the overall approach, a small sample of abstract tasks, and a few examples of inspection results are presented."

    "abstract": "\"Too often, the computer is used in the schools, as it is used in other social establishments, as a quick technological fix. It is used to paper over fundamental problems to create the illusion that they are being attacked.\" [Joesph Weizenbaum, Ph.D., Professor of Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in \"Computers and Education\", BYTE (June 1984) vol. 9 no. 6, p 225 ] I wish to pose two series of fundamental philosophical questions in this paper. These arise from this statement about computers in education and I will attempt to apply them in examining the relationship between Museums and the Web. The first series deals with the application of this technology to the central mission of museums, \"to collect, to preserve and to educate\". Many studies have shown that the introduction of Information Technologies (I.T.) has not significantly increased per capita efficiency of companies. In our rush to adopt computer-based communication technologies and restructure our institutions to make use them, do we run the risk of losing more than we might gain? What might be the long-term side effects for museums of \"being digital\"? The second series of questions are related to the first. In a different economic environment, would we have chosen the web as a primary communication vehicle? Museums have undergone a period of tremendous re-structuring and re-focusing over the last five years. Budget reductions, slashed staff, loss of audience have been widely experienced. In this period of turmoil we have, perhaps paradoxically, seen a huge growth in the use of computer-based information technologies in museums (at all levels of education for that matter). Has this money been well spent, or are we papering over the cracks? The bottom line question I will try to address is simple, with all this I.T. are we doing our job better or not?"

Even as some museum exhibitions and galleries struggle to survive in the 90's low funding climate, web based exhibitions and other museum activities have grown rapidly alongside the new information technologies, offering new opportunities and new methods of exhibition. I propose this session to examine the direction of web-based museum activities.

The panel will discuss the visual/human interface for the development of a web based virtual museums and exhibitions. It seems as if every museum is or will get, \"on line\". The claim is to use the web to broaden the audience, attract new viewers and give a new wave of access to arts.

Specifically the panel needs to address the use of interactive technologies used in the development of the web to distribute art exhibitions.

The On-line Learning Environment [ ole.fsu.edu] is composed of virtual exhibition space developed using interactive 3-D and sound/video transmissions technologies based on the physical exhibits at a new Cultural Center (art and science museum) that is opening in Tallahassee, Florida. Developed for visitors to explore and enrich their education of the arts by using high-quality telecommunications and information technology it will use several technologies which can be down-loaded at no cost from a web browser including: html, vrml, java-scripting (which includes video and audio-streaming), speech synthesis and robotics control via web pages. The Cultural Center's exhibitions will serve as the basis of an interactive experience accessible by web browsers where the viewer will be able to explore and interact with the exhibitions. Sound will serve as both an instructor and guide as one moves through the virtual museum website. Frequent Internet broadcasts of lecturers, demonstrations, video conferencing and interactive exhibitions will serve to extend access to the Cultural Center to those who can not visit the museum. The On-line Learning Environment is a view of a museum of the 21st century. One that is not just one room, one exhibition, one catalogue and one subject bound, but a blending of information and issues as they cross each other. This web site is more than linking text/image driven information. It is creating a visual interactive virtual environment that blends information gathering, sorting and recreating to reinforce the exhibition from both being there and being there virtually."

The focus is on the experience of creating and developing a virtual museum in a peripheral and Third Word country. The construction of a real art museum like the outstanding ones in the First World would have cost a prohibitive sum for the Uruguayan economy. The Web was used to overcome financial limitations. Uruguay doesn't have a modern, big, state of the art museum but now it can have it, to an extent, in virtual reality. That is why MUVA is projected to give the sensation of being inside a real museum. Thus the building was designed by four architects commissioned for the MUVA and later built for Internet by graphic designers and webmasters. The visitor can actually walk inside the museum, take the elevator, go up the stairs. At the same Uruguay doesn't have the budget to organize several itinerary exhibitions per year and that is why many people do not know about Uruguayan art. MUVA exhibits original works of art photographed by a team of photographers from private collections and studios. It has the copyright and special permission. The aim in this case is to show works of art that are locked away from view and in private places that people usually don't have accesss to. Another important goal is to give opportunity to show their art to cutting edge artists from Uruguay. So from the beginning MUVA exhibits works of arts by Uruguayan masters and by emerging artists."

    "abstract": "Is the pervasive display of digital icons and graphical images in the cyberspace is where the reality of an art museum stops and digital art and digital media begins? Will an exclusive digital media museum segregates existing art aficionados from the techno-art aficionados despite all diversity and backgrounds? How will the current generation of digital art progresses into digital-antiques? If so, will current auction houses accept this art form or will it naturally evolve into the making of the digital-auction-houses-of-the-future? These are the immediate concerns of the author who straddles between fine arts and technology. While preservation and conservation will no longer be an important issue for digital media, there are other difficulties and new issues arise from cradling this new medium. This paper examines the necessity of building a real world media museum exclusively to collect and exhibit digital artworks. It defines and categorizes digital medium, surveys and asserts fundamentals, highlights the issues involved in building such a museum from its conceptualization, design to implementation as it questions the architectural prerequisites, uniqueness and functional infrastructure. By an unprecedented categorization of the digital medium, it discusses the qualification of the curatorial jurisdiction, art critic and the quantification of the acquisition and valuation of the digital artworks. From previews to reviews, from the exhibits layout to the can't-do-without hardcopy art catalog, this paper discusses the nature and matters of staging a digital media museum, its Web presence and its relation to digital art events. It delineates between binary space and real world space as it encapsulates the digital medium in a real world museum."

This paper will focus on the processes involved in integrating object-centered learning and technology in the classroom, and the role museums play in extending learning beyond the classroom. Museum outreach has added a new direction with the \"Museum in the Classroom\" project through the use of computer technology and the Internet. Through this project, students are exposed to cultural diversity, learn diverse research methods, and cultivate state-of-the art technology skills."

    "abstract": "The Canadian Visual Arts Information Network (CCCAnet) is an on-line database project profiling contemporary Canadian visual artists and their work. It currently includes more than 2,000 images by more than 80 artists. Much of the work involved in building the database and the CCCAnet website has been carried out by high school and college students working through partnerships with The Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art. The learning benefits of the Student Interactive Imaging Program have been many. It has provided the students with a practical project through which to learn marketable technological skills, a new opportunity to experience contemporary Canadian art, and a community education-based method to aid in the building of an important national visual art information resource. The Student Interactive Imaging Program has been supported in part by SchoolNet Digital Collections, an innovative program of Industry Canada designed to give young people technology-based job experience convering collections of material into digital form. This presentation will describe the CCCAnet project, illustrate the student-developed, web-enabled database, and suggest how such a program could easily be extended to museums, providing them with a valuable, cost-effective partnership to aid in the automation and dissemination of their collections while enhancing their educational activities."

    "year": "1998",
    "abstract": "In 1996, a multi-stage project was started aiming to establish a free-access public Web site which serves as a virtual museum of fine arts in Hungary. The objectives were 1) to work out the prob-lems connected with the creation of large image collections and their transformation into a vir-tual museum; 2) to set up a collection of large size digital reproductions of Hungarian artworks (suitable for viewing on a screen of 800 x 600 or higher resolution); and 3) to create a virtual museum from the collection. The collection shall include all significant artists (not only Hungarians) who worked within the borders of the country and exerted an influence on the development of art. The technical details of creating and maintaining a virtual museum were elaborated by experimenting with a model entitled \"Web Gallery of Art\" which presently contains 3000 reproductions of European artworks and is operating since October 1996. The aim of this contribution is to report the results of the first (completed in May, 1997) and second (to be completed in December, 1997) stages of the project. As a result of the first stage, the Web site entitled \"Painting in Hungary from the Beginning to the Mid 20th Century\" was established. The collection contains 1300 large-size reproductions of artworks by 200 artists, it covers painting, mural paintings, winged altarpieces, miniatures, stained glass windows and tapestries. The large amount of interlinked textual information as well as additional services provided for the visitors make the collection a virtual museum. The biographies of all artists, the essential data of all artworks, and comments on the most important artworks are given in two identical, Hungarian and English language versions. The \"navigation\" in the museum is easy, the presentation is organized, pleasing and user-friendly. A powerful search engine makes it possible to search the collection for specific picture or information. At the end of the second stage the number of reproductions exceeds 2000, the collection extends to sculpture (including medieval stone and wooden carvings), virtual \"guided tours\" are offered to view different cross-sections of the collection. The technical aspects of creating and maintaining the collection, the operating experiences of a one year period (including a summary of visitors' response), and plans for the third stage will also be reported."

    "abstract": "Every institution has multiple uses for its data. That is why many museum Web sites are on-line versions of brochures or ugly extensions of collection management software. Much of the work in repurposing museum data has looked at interchange and graphics standards. This has its virtues but getting data from one system to another is not particularly difficult. The challenge is in adapting the same data to the needs of different environments. In moving a kiosk application to the Web at DMC we learned many lessons in how, and how not to, do this which we generalised in two tools: MusDev, for building standalone and networked museum kiosk applications, and WebDev, for designing and managing complex Web sites which make extensive use of on-line databases. We do not (quite!) have a series of buttons offering options of “publish catalogue,” “create Web site,” “build touchscreen application” but in creating multi-environment applications such as antique golf club collections and a virtual maritime museum we have discovered how to eliminate much of the tedium of data repurposing by making the right decisions up-front and by automating many of the processes."

Using the digital medium as a tool and a space for presentation, Walker Art Center's Teen Web class participants began learning the basics of web creation in an attempt to address important issues facing young adults today via the World Wide Web. The goal of the course was to familiarize students with the medium of the Internet as a tool for creative expression and its capabilities to communicate and ellicit responses from peers, parents and teachers. With an emphasis on critical analysis of both new and \"old\" media, the class determined what its main concerns and issues were and created an area built specifically by them reflecting those concerns and offering intelligent visual interpretations and responses. Each student has begun to create a visual/verbal \"response\" to the issues using one or a combination of media: photographic image, text, animation, and sound that will voice their particular concerns and interests."

    "abstract": "Miss Traill's House (the “real one”) is a National Trust house museum in Bathurst, NSW, Australia. Built in the mid-19th century and replete with artefacts both grand and mundane, the house museum serves as a valuable resource for CSU public history students. It's here classroom theories on hegemonic discourse, thick and thin interpretation and similar topics assume practical form. For external students, however, a visit to the house is difficult, if not impossible. For these students, a simple computer simulated version of Miss Traill\\'s House has been developed, initially on disk. It is now available to students through the Internet, part of a wider project to make the entire subject Internet accessible. This paper will discuss the process of developing the simulated museum and consider its practical use as an Internet teaching resource for internal and external students. Particular attention has been given in the design to show students how artefacts can reveal something of their owners and how changes to the fabric of a building are messages from long ago occupants. The computer version of Miss Traill\\'s House was low budget in expenditure, minimalist in technology and involved students in its design and construction."

However, in spite of the abundance and accessibility of data in digital form, the impact on art education is minimal. The main premise of this paper is that although the information is made available and accessible it is (for the most part) still not useful for potential users. It is argued that the main problems are not technological in nature (narrow bandwidth, etc.) but rather are problems in the domain of interface conceptualization and design. Basic criteria for making educational WWW interfaces usable and useful are suggested."

In the virtual world, the collective presence and role of the museum community can be enhanced by providing effective access and retrieval strategies that relate the different types of available information, offer the potential for integrating and extending its value and relevancy, and help reveal implicit narratives embedded in it. Beyond this, consideration must be given to the potential experiences that can be offered on-line audiences, given the variety of their perspectives and expectations. This paper will consider a number of key questions and relate them to current developments at the Canadian Heritage Information Network: What is an information meta-centre and what is its role? What are the needs and expectations of our audiences? What tools are needed to address the different points of view and navigational needs of the users and in what ways can an information meta-centre facilitate the retrieval of content-rich resources? * What is needed to develop a diverse information meta-centre that serves the needs of many different audiences?"

The purpose of this discussion will be to assist museum administrators in identifying their intellectual property. Specific attention will be given to digital images and \"collections of museum information\" - ie. Databases. 2) once museum administrators have determined what intellectual property may be available, their next step must be to identify their users and the uses requested. The paper will focus on educational users for non-profit and for profit use and commercial users for profit use. The discussion will focus on various exceptions and defences, such as fair use and fair dealing available in the US, Canada and the European Union that allow users to access museum intellectual property without prior authorization. 3) mechanisms or vehicles to facilitate reasonable access to museum intellectual property will be explored. Copyright provisions may not provide sufficient protection in our current legal environment for certain types of intellectual property."

    "abstract": "Conservators at advanced museum laboratories around the world have been at the forefront in developing laser technology and high quality digital imagery, and the international conservation community has been a leader in establishing Internet resources for sharing up-to-date technical information. Their success, growing out of specific needs, demonstrates the importance of discipline-specific resources for museum research and public programs. Especially as web standards are being adopted, often with little involvement of discipline-specific users, the unique character of many museum collections, ranging from rare works of art to objects of everyday use and specimens of the natural world, is in danger of being homogenized and the discipline-specific needs of their staffs and publics overlooked. Because museums are engaged in archaeological excavations and natural history studies in many parts of the world, these needs also impact the growing industry in cultural and environmental tourism, a major opportunity for public education. This paper will take the fields of conservation and historic preservation as a case example of the need for discipline-specific resources and will review the most advanced uses and future potential of museum sites in this field. It will conclude with a presentation of several model web pages which I am currently developing as a demonstration of the potential of the web for research and public education in this fast growing field."

    "abstract": "In this paper we discuss some topics related to knowledge representation, and the mechanisms that can be used to bring that knowledge to the user, mostly through the Web. This topic became relevant, when we faced the problem of publishing large amounts of data from several different sources, in the context of project GEIRA, an EC supported project under the INTERREG II program, that is developing a service to publish multimedia information about science and technology, cultural resources and environmental protection in the North of Portugal and Galiza (North-West Spain). The problem is not one of making a visible presence for each institution on the Web, but of taking advantage of the complete information delivered by them all. For the participating museums, we would like user to visit each museum but, more than that, to see related collections or objects, available in other museums. The diversity of institutions participating in the project GEIRA is so rich, that the user can see other information related to some objects, like the biography of the author, a list of publications citing the object, and even see (through a GIS plug-in) the archaeological site where an object was found. The major discussion in this paper is of two different models for data representation: the relational database and annotated documents. As we will show the former has advantages when manipulating structured data and has several sophisticated and affordable tools available. The later model is suited for less structured information, or at least, before a formal structure is identified. To be less structured does not mean that we cannot use useful tools, like thesaurus and encyclopedia views. As an open question, for future work, is the possibility of using some hybrid model, with the advantages of both data models."

    "abstract": "This paper will discuss ideas of object representation within the museum, addressing the fragility of object collections, and will explore the potential of virtual reality technologies to define new ways of viewing museum space and display. The system of organising and classifying object collections is regarded as the core of museum activity as a cultural institution. But these very same collections are susceptible to heat, dust, light all of which result in collections spending most of their time in storage sheds away from main museum buildings and display spaces. The introduction of virtual environments within the museum may be the answer to displaying more of the collection more often. Virtual museum spaces which allow objects to be chosen from databases and viewed within contextual environments could see the creation of intriguing virtual museum spaces constructed individually for each new visitor. Virtual museums may provide the potential for all object collections to be viewed randomly anytime a visitor enters the virtual space. Display spaces in turn could be programmed to construct themselves at the moment of perception and events take place without curator anticipation of visitor interests. Dynamic database driven vrml which 'learn' the habits and likes of the user are being developed at the same time that virtual reality software is allowing construction of virtual spaces in real time. RoboCam technology which surveys physical space from a given point has the potential to overlap both physical and virtual environments. This paper will focus on the dichotomy between real and virtual museum space and object representation within that space."

To the public, ZKM offers an opportunity to share in this exciting process, to play and experiment with unprecedented possibilities. The 'Salon Digital' is the museum's virtual wing and ZKM's window to the outside world. Visitors to the salon have full access to the Internet, and surfers on the Net are reciprocally invited to visit the ZKMI Media Museum via the same gateway.

    "abstract": "Museums have embraced the World Wide Web as a natural tool for promotion, publishing and communication but have been less swift to explore its potential as an exhibition medium. Part of this reticence is a well founded concern with the difficulty of providing the authenticity of a real interaction with real objects and real activities, the hallmark of the museum experience. And yet the Web, unlike any other mass communication media, has the potential to support an audio-visual browsing relationship with a subject which can be akin to some aspects of a museum visit. Fortunately, the initial wave of \"Virtual Museums\", not surprisingly developed mostly by non museum people, has passed by. The question remains \"What can happen if museum exhibit designers would focus their design skills on creating WWW experiences?\" This paper will discuss our current thinking about the use of an exhibition mentality in the design of online material through a presentation of some of the recent experimental Exploratorium Web projects including live Webcasting of remote field experiences to an onsite and online public, the creation of on-line interactive exhibits and the development of an exhibition Website structure."

Smith will outline what he believes those policies, practices and roles might need to be and should encompass in order to meet the demands of the Internet consumer. Finally, he will suggest strategies that museums might adopt to help them undertake the task of redefining and repositioning themselves."

What's the coming together of these meant for Te Papa - whose new building opening in February 1998 is the biggest national museum project under way anywhere in the world - and the largest single cultural investment ever made by a New Zealand government. There has been vigorous debate within Te Papa over what the website should be - who should drive it - how should it add value to corporate strategies - what it could mean for a museum whose founding statute set the objective of its being \"a forum for the nation\". In the wider context, New Zealand has a reputation for fast uptake of new information technologies: its website has to successfully compete for attention with those of the other major institutions of national identity. For schools, the Web is now a mainstream knowledge access channel; there are competitors for supply of content, yet what richer source of content is there than the Museum's superb research-based collections? For the indigenous people, the Maori, internet technologies are giving real meaning to access to oral and visual information - there are hard issues here for how the Museum presents itself. The Conference is something of a case study of: one Museum building the Web into its change process; how intellectual property rights and revenue opportunities are affected leveraging the Web potential for interaction with all New Zealanders - a forum for the nation; how to ensure dynamic updating with cost-efficiency principles hyperlinks - the real key to museums, archives and libraries working together."

A web menu- interface was planned to provide access to cataloging information about digital images which would be provided over the network. Before this interface could be created, a large number of images were needed to study the organization and access method to be employed to assist students in obtaining the works they wanted to view online and to provide accurate information about the images themselves. This presentation will take you through the process which brought these digital images to the desktops of all Columbia students and affiliates with network access from their residence halls, dorms, apartments and Columbianet terminals within the libraries. Mostly we will concern ourselves with metadata--the contextual information about the image which must be present to access, identify, and supplement the visual content. How the metadata was constructed and organized to function as an index to the collections, including many of the problems encountered in cataloging image surrogates of works of art, will be examined."

For this purpose a historical quarter of the city of Berlin has been reconstructed in three different time levels (1855, 1928, 1992). In addition this platform will serve as an environment for the presentation of exhibitions about various subjects. Exhibits in digitized form (text, pictures sound, film clips and three-dimensional objects) will be included online from the databases of the associated museums and archives. The paper mainly deals with four topics: Which possibilities can be gained by integrating exhibits in a specific spatial and historical context? What are the consequences regarding the selection of suitable exhibition objects? What are the requirements for the institutions to share the same VR-platform in an interdisciplinary collaboration? Is the metadata approach an adequate solution for the management of different information from distributed databases? What are the positive side effects of combining various exhibitions on a common platform? Is it possible to re-use parts of one exhibition as a folio for another one? Which new communication methods are introduced by using Virtual Reality? Does a collaborative multi-user concept add value to the restricted forms of conventional presentations? Is a VR-platform suitable for exhibition concepts designed for different target groups? What are the requirements for navigating in a virtual environment?"

Over these local databases we put an index database -called M.A.MA- containing 12 elements available in each collection. The local databases are stored and maintained on the local servers, however for security reasons only the well protected central computer is serving information to the Internet . This central computer will provide place for individual museum home pages too. The M.A.MA database is accessible on 3 main levels. The first for the public, limited searching capabilities but accessible for everyone from the internet. On the 2 level the general database can be found with free searching capabilities, and the third level is closed, this is the researchers database, which contains detailed information about the objects of collections. The project didn't standardize at the level of the different collections data, but it has attempted to serve provide for general searching. This paper will present the results of this project include the solution of the museological problems and the professional technological background."

    "year": "1998",
    "abstract": "The Guide to Canadian Museums and Galleries, launched by CHIN in July 1996, is the direct result of a Directors meeting held in the Spring of 1995 where the museum community voiced its desire to use the Internet as one means to attract new audiences. In its new directions, CHIN moved away from client-based services and towards the idea of \"Membership\". In this way, all \"Members\" of the virtual community, i.e., CHIN and museums, would work together to create a collective resource on the Internet - the Guide. There is an investment on the part of all Members - CHIN maintains all technical components of the Guide in addition to providing Internet accounts and training to Members and museums contribute information about their collections and events - and therefore, a stake in the future success or failure of the Guide. The more complete and current the information is, the more successful the Guide will be in attracting new audiences and bringing back repeat visitors. With the potential for virtual visits to translate into actual visits, everyone benefits including the general public who has a new and reliable resource to use. This paper will analyze the Guide in terms of what works and what needs to be reviewed. The concept of \"Membership\" will also be assessed based on the changing needs of the virtual community - what does membership involve from CHIN's standpoint?, what is the perception of membership among museums?, is 'membership' a valid term to represent the reality of the virtual community? This paper will also examine the future direction of the Guide in terms of the virtual community and perceived challenges for both CHIN and museums."

    "year": "1998",
    "abstract": "The speaker will present an overview of research about the human-computer interface or user-centred research for the web from a museologist's point of view. Then she will discuss the state of the art of museology and its implications for museums on the web. There are those who would argue that the museum experience can in no way be transferred to the web? Essentially, this question refers back to the essential question of what is a museum, and what is the museum experience. Current research about the museum and the museum experience takes us into a museum paradigm based in the user-created experience of museums and even into the very essence of making museum that could adopt to the web in ways that support, and extend, the museum idea? More than the object fetishism, more than information and data transfer, and certainly more than public relations and sales opportunities, the museum experience is about meaning and knowledge building. What, then, is the essence of the museum experience that we wish to transfer to the web and what can we effectively create in web technology given current developments? Work in the last decade in Scandinavia in participatory design for information technology offers some important opportunities that parallel much of the thinking of the new museology or what I like to call participatory museology. Similarly work in computer-supported collaborative learning (cscl) and collaborative work (cscw) offer some important conceptual shifts extending our picture of the user experience beyond the solitary viewer or web user to address more social forms of involvement in the museum experience. Perhaps, as important, work in the visitor experience of museums may also have relevance for the field of human-computer interface research."

    "abstract": "The content of museums falls into distinct classes: Objects, Information and Experience. Information clearly has a place on the web, while objects and the magic of their presence cannot be sent over wires. But what about experience? How can the museum-going experience be delivered on the web? A web-based experience may be intrinsically tied to content - in a sense it may be the content. Or it may be extrinsic, one of many possible content presentation methods. It may involve using the computer as a presentation medium, as an object, or not at all. This paper will examine these various approaches to web experience, with examples from the International Digital Media Award winning Ontario Science Centre Interactive Zone."

The valuable experiences culled from this enterprise have been transformed into a concrete guide that can provide valuable aide to all who embark on a similar adventure. The experiences of those involved in the creation of the Christmas Traditions in France and in Canada virtual exhibition were recorded and subsequently evaluated. The purpose being to produce a guide on the production of virtual exhibitions which could be used by other institutions interested in the creation of similar projects, particularly those involving several collaborative and/or international partners. This publication, a condensed version of which is available on-line on the CHIN Web site, will be available in late 1997. It provides insight into projects of this nature (international and collaborative) in which museums and technology merge/meet to produce a visually and intellectually rich presentation that educates and entertains a large audience via the Internet."

    "year": "1998",
    "abstract": "Since the beginning of 1997, The Palace of The Governors, New Mexico's State History Museum, has been planning a project and implementing it with the SER Academy, an alternative Santa Fe high school for at-risk, predominantly Hispanic youth, and Santa Fe Community College. The project these partners are engaged in is the U.S. civil war in New Mexico. In it, related photographs, manuscripts, books, and artifacts are being re-photographed, digitized, and catalogued by the teenage students. The students are using these materials to create the civil war in New Mexico Web Site; the site will be available on computers at The Palace of The Governors and on the World Wide Web. What this model project suggests is, one, there are nearly limitless opportunities in New Mexico to translate museum, archival, and library collections into electronic forms which people can access, independent of location. Given the huge quantity of materials that need to be digitally captured, shaped (into databases, web sites, curricula, etc.), and published, a second opportunity presents itself: training young people in work for which there is so obvious a demand and for which, we contend, there will be jobs. This suggests the third and final portion of the paper: there are large sectors of the population today who, like the kids at the SER Academy, are considered by many to be a burden on society; this project suggests that such persons can be trained and employed in meaningful work and thereby become assets to the society which now marginalizes them."

    "url": "https://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw98/abstracts/van_alstyne.html",
    "year": "1998",
    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the theory and practice of the MoMA Web site -- its design logic, workflow, and relationship to the Museum. As we will see in some detail, the site has remained focused through the application of specific tenets of Modernist design; it has been generated by the pursuit of pleasure in both the visual and the conceptual realm; and most surprisingly, it has evolved as a study in applied cybernetics. Originating in the 1940s alongside the birth of the first \"ultra-rapid computing machines,\" cybernetics was conceived as the science of control and communication in the animal and the machine. The term, coined by mathematician Norbert Weiner and his colleagues, was derived from the Greek word for \"helmsman,\" whose role was to provide adaptive control of a vessel. This state of control is understood to be determined by the flow of information. Cybernetics is thus concerned with the theory of information and with concepts such as feedback, entropy, signal, noise, medium, message, and homeostasis, the state of dynamic equilibrium. Always a transdiciplinary subject, cybernetics has application not only to the patterns and signals which comprise the Web site itself, but also the crucial system of social and professional communications which create and sustain the site as an enterprise. Although cybernetics lends its name to the popular term \"cyberspace,\" the term is curiously absent from recent discussions in informatics. In seeking to answer some of the difficult questions facing museums as they develop an online presence, this paper will propose the return of cybernetics to the center stage of contemporary discourse about the Web. Greg's paper will be published in UNESCO's journal, Museum International."

    "year": "1998",
    "abstract": "The World Wide Web has changed our expectations of information access forever. We now take it for granted that we can search vast repositories of information with ease and at extremely low cost. Whereas we used to travel to the information repository to manually seek out what we sought we are now able to use the services of digital robots and vast digital indeces to seek out that information. But as with most activities on the Web the searching activity takes place in isolation. We are unable to communicate with the information provider about our needs. If we know what we are looking for and generally where it is we have a reasonable chance of finding it. If we don't know what we are looking for there is no one to turn to. A new technology, XML, provides a possible mechanism for addressing this problem. XML, which is an evolutionary branch of SGML, can be used as a means of providing the \"electronic reference librarian\". XML's impact on Web information delivery is already being felt in \"push\" technologies which are based on \"CDF\", an implementation of XML. This paper will explore how XML can be used: to move beyond turning the Web into a thousand speciality TV channels by institutions to inform Web surfers what the institution knows, how it organizes that knowledge in a meaningful way, and how it wants the user to access that knowledge base to create interactive digital dialogs that will guide a user through a knowledge base as a feedback mechanism that will help providers understand how users interact with their presentations."

Some museum professionals have even worried that the Web will eventually destroy the art museum altogether, once potential visitors and patrons have ready access to large numbers of digital art images in their own homes. This paper will look at the \"the original\" in an era of digitized reproductions to see if it has, in fact, lost its long-held power over the human imagination. The paper will begin with the biological origins of image-making in human pre-history and will examine how copies and reproductions have affected the cultural significance of art objects over the centuries, from Roman copies of Greek originals, to the engraved art reproductions of the Renaissance, the chromolithograph of Victorian times, to the high-tech reproductions of today. It will show how the process of reproduction itself changes meaning in art, in ways which are both positive and negative. It will conclude with an examination of how new technologies and the rapid distribution of art images are likely to change the meaning of the original in our own era."

    "abstract": "As a burgeoning “virtual institution,” Franklin Furnace is pioneering new territory. In the early 90s, Franklin Furnace began to take steps to “dematerialize” as a result of the shared perception of both the Founding Director and the Board that the current model of an alternative space might not adequately serve the community of avant-garde artists now spread beyond the boroughs of New York to places across the nation and around the world. The process has evolved beyond our expectations: In 1993, Franklin Furnace's artist book collection was acquired by MOMA; in 1996 it mounted its 20th Anniversary show to conclude its exhibition program with a bang, and it also launched its website as its public face on February 1, 1997. Our loft was sold in September, 1997, and in many ways, the anxiety that lay behind the question of what a “virtual institution” might be or what it could accomplish was unleashed. We now consider the point we have reached to be an opportunity to re-consider the role of Franklin Furnace in relation to the community of artists and the culture at large, programs that will best serve to fulfill our mission, the basis upon which Franklin Furnace can and should sustain its mission. Franklin Furnace will be remembered in art history for having championed art undervalued by mainstream institutions—artists' books, temporary installation and performance art; and additionally for standing up for artists' right to freedom of expression. At present, Franklin Furnace is continuing its rethinking process without preconceived notions as to the end result—in one, two or five years. Franklin Furnace is exploring the feasibility of becoming a peripatetic institution—spending one year in Beijing, another year in Santiago, still another in Rotterdam—to explode the identification of the institution with its real estate and to undertake projects that emerge from local needs but may attract an international audience. Franklin Furnace is developing a cybercast program of performance art, Franklin Furnace @ Pseudo.com, that expands the organization's history of developing and preserving a new artistic medium and offering resources to emerging artists, while enabling us to re-establish our unique niche at the visual end of the performance art spectrum. Additionally, Franklin Furnace is commencing a multi-year project, Avant-Garde New York, 1976–96, through which Franklin Furnace will develop its institutional archives, which contain primary materials that increase in value with each day that passes."

A single individual (the author) was tasked with creating a pilot Web site. After a few months, ambitions outpaced the scope of a pilot project and it became necessary to find ways to involve managers and staff in the various areas of the museum more closely with the development of the site. This paper will identify the reasons behind creating CMC's Web site and the goals set for the site, and will outline the development of the site, paying attention particularly to the organization of content creation and quality control mechanisms. It will examine alternative approaches to content creation, including in-house and external production, and will consider desirable qualifications of content creators in a museum context. Consideration will also be given to where, in an organization, responsibility for a Web site should fall, as well as to broader issues of cultural change within an institution. The paper will focus on the experience of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, but will not pretend to have general solutions to the issues, many of which continue to be problematic at this time -- for reasons which will be addressed."

This included the first online pages about the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, Centre Pompidou, and other museums, and monuments in the City. It has been celebrated in the international press since 1994. The ambitions of the site are to provide cultural, documentary, and educational content. Over the last 30 months, it has grown to 8000+ pages, and 3000+ images, with roughly 6 million accesses per month. It has done near real time reporting of news and events in Paris since 1995. Since November 1996, there has been a true online Boutique with secure transactions. The Boutique sells cultural and educational items, such as CD-ROM by the Reunion des musees nationaux (RMN). The content and technical dimensions of the server are vast enough that we have been confronted with many issues not currently discussed in the general 'Internet' press, and have had to find solutions to them. This has involved creation ofWeb database management tools, HTML creation tools, as well as tools for managing diverse data types (images, text, addresses, telephone numbers, geographic location, metro stops, figure captions, history, current events etc.) in a way conducive to using them in the Web site. Other issues are related handling the correspondence generated by an estimated 500,000 unique 'sessions' per month, and finally, copyright, and financial issues."

Or your interest might even extend beyond a single department. With computerization and public access projects, museums are increasingly called upon to provide information drawn from a great deal of heterogeneous material. This paper investigates fundamental approaches to constructing integrated museum information systems. A key element in the process of building these systems is the development of a thorough understanding of the data structures and formats within your organization. Also critical is the need to determine how data ought to be stored and shaped, and how a museum would like the data to be displayed, once it is retrieved. Practical examples are drawn from projects in which the authors have participated, including the Oregon Historical Society's Collections Access Project, sponsored by the U. S. Dept. of Education, and the Museum Educational Site Licensing Project, sponsored by the Getty Information Institute, and The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. An overview is provided of current Web and database technology that supports integrated systems development, and consideration is given to the ways in which these technologies match existing information access systems."

The Digital Darwins concept envisions the electronic delivery of museum objects to K-12 classrooms around the country, and the provision of those classrooms with the hardware and software tools to enable students to create their own digital models of specimens from their local environments to comparison and interaction with the museum material. Thus students may truly become scientists and researchers, and classrooms may become museums. The Digital Darwins project is an interdisciplinary effort conducted jointly with the BioVisualization of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. Alfie Rosenberger, Director. Charles Calvo, acting as Director of the S/ARC Digital Research and Imaging Lab (DRIL) supervised two undergraduate students during the month of July, 1996 to produce the Web site to coincide with the Smithsonian's 150th anniversary. The site is the world's first three-dimensional Natural History Web site. The work represents a significant advance in the application of three-dimensional modeling and visualization to morphology and systematic biology, especially in areas such as feature identification, measurement and comparative study. And the work demonstrates the potential to create exciting, object based delivery of museum material to K-12 science classes via the Internet."

In one of the ways we achieve this mission, we are using the information transfer abilities of the World Wide Web. We offer a site from a major research institute specifically designed as a resource to the museum community. It is our belief that this is unique: while there are many sites from research institutes which the science museum community can use, these sites are usually designed for the general public or for classroom educators. Other sites designed for museum staff use offer exhibits, but little in the way of easy-to-access information of general interest. In this presentation we outline the resources available through our site (which is currently under construction and will be available in March). This includes HST images, science background articles, and a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about HST and its astronomy. In addition, we offer a resource list of exhibits, planetarium programs, classroom activities, etc. about HST. Also available is an \"advanced notice\" system, where authorized browsers can see the contents of press releases before the general public - helping make science centers an authority the public can turn to when new results are released. Relevant topics include: Museum Exhibitions on the Web; Consortia, National, and International Projects; Imagebases, Multimedia, and Publishing; and, New Technologies & Opportunities for the Near Future."

    "year": "1997",
    "abstract": "The advent of scholarly resources on the Web already allows more people to research a greater number of topics in more depth than ever before. Increased access will bring about sophisticated understanding and questions from people previously excluded from the dialogues of professional scholarship. Because of the larger audience for scholarship, the Web will likely foster the skeptical evaluation of scholars' claims, the articulation of new questions, and a growing need for clarification through research. Thus, the playing field for academic scholarship will be leveled somewhat, but more generally raised. Experts will be called upon even more for their specialized knowledge and interpretive skills. In this environment, what sorts of online tools will humanists, including museum curators and art historians, need? For the groundwork of research, the utility of a digital library like the Perseus Project is obvious. Computers simplify tedious tasks, such as compiling indices; resolve disparities, like variant names or spellings; and connect resources, including objects in different museums. A review of Perseus resources which facilitate scholarship also shows its current boundaries as a scholarly tool, however. By examining these limitations, we might generate a wish-list of Web resources which will provide scholars with the means for advanced research by allowing them to exploit the advantages of networked information."

    "abstract": "The idea of linking up with computing science students on the lookout for projects is not in itself exclusive to the Hunterian. However, an undergraduate operating independently, with limited resources is not likely to be able to produce a product of sufficiently high quality to meet the requirements of most museums. (We all know what most student home pages look like!) The Hunterian Museum in Glasgow has developed a close cooperation with the honors program course coordinators in the Department of Computing Science. Students receive full academic recognition for their team efforts in developing the Museum's site as the Department of Computing Science ensure that the tasks given are sufficiently technically difficult to meet the curricular demands of the honors program. They appreciate having a \"real world\" client for the students, and the success of the collaboration has meant we always receive the very best students for the projects. This doesn't come without a museum contribution, however. Museum curators must make time available and allow access to collections for the students. The students also need a lot of direction and supervision in order to ensure the final product meets museum requirements for design and corporate image, and is effective for the educational end user."

But it does not necessarily follow that this investment will result in improved intellectual access to museum holdings or new audiences. The reasons why the best of intentions are unlikely to yield expected returns include: * current ideas about online Public Access; * the information systems that lie behind Public Access systems; and, * the organizational structure of museums (particularly US museums) The purpose of this presentation will be to: * examine the good intentions of Public Access; * dissect how Web-based Public Access usually manifests itself; * discuss the information systems that currently feed this approach; * propose a new model for what might constitute Public Access (and attempt to rename it); and, * discuss the information and organizational systems required for this new model The presentation will include illustrations drawn from the Web and mock-ups of proposed Web-enabled museum educational sites."

    "abstract": "The Electronic Library Image Service for Europe project is now in its second phase. The pilot project which ran from Feb. 93 to Jan. 95 looked at the feasibility of providing museum and library images and related text to users based across Europe via the Internet. Working with partners like IBM, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Tilburg University, we produced working prototype applications for MS Windows and X-Windows before the emergence of the Web and associated browsers. ELISE II has been funded for the next three years (from Oct. 96) and now has nine partners, bringing new material in a variety of subject areas, including scientific imaging. With the explosion in the use of the Web and browsers like Netscape, it is obvious that for wide access applications delivering data over the Internet, this environment is essential for developers to use. ELISE II will develop a system that will manage the whole process of providing an image service, including User Validation, User Profiles, Standard Metadata Models such as the Dublin Core, Thesauri Expansion, Searching by Image Content, Searching across Disparate Databases, Distributed Images, support for Multimedia Objects including Streaming Video and Audio, Copyright Requirements and Management of various Payment Schemes. This paper outlines the project requirements and suggests some of the ideas and system designs which we believe will fulfill these requirements."

    "abstract": "It is clear that we are witnessing a time of tremendous change and opportunity. While governments around the world are preparing for economic, social, and political changes spurred by new information technologies, those of us in the cultural arena cannot afford to sit in ivory towers and simply let events overtake us. While mounting more and more stand alone Web sites is a fundamental step into the cyberspace universe, it is just the beginning. In reality, cyberspace itself is currently raucous and untamed territory. Digital information alone is only a stream of millions of bits. It makes no sense if we have no way of knowing where to look for information or if different formats for recording text and images prevent us from access across Web sites. The great collective repository of our cultural heritage scattered around the world in libraries, museums, and archives contains vast numbers of art objects and literary works from the past and present. These are fragments of the great mosaic of human civilization. To make sure these pieces can be accessed across collections in ways that benefit our understanding of humankind and improve our quality of life, we need work together as collaborators in developing community and multi-institutional Web sites locally, nationally, and globally. Fortunately, a handful of models are leading the way."

    "abstract": "The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Web site is piloting a section called “You're the Expert,” that presents each month a real-case scenario that invites visitors to play the role of a museum expert. One month visitors may have to decide the most effective way to light a piece of sculpture, another month they have to create an inviting title for an upcoming exhibition, write a label for a new acquisition, or select an appropriate period frame for a painting. The intent of this section is multifarious addressing the needs and interests of both the visitor and the museum. Visitors get a behind-the-scenes look at different museum professions, an opportunity to learn something about the art, and a chance to talk to us and each other about what they've discovered. The museum, on the other hand, has an on-going focus group that helps us \"eavesdrop\" on what general audiences find most interesting; e.g., what exhibition titles attract them or what information they want in a label. This information can then be used to improve our marketing strategies and educational offerings. This paper will explore these other models and suggest ways for museums to better exploit this new technology. Such models will help museum's expand their web site traffic beyond the current tourist and teacher audiences to include the traditional non-museum visitor who might just discover that there's something for them at their local museum after all."

The ultimate goal of the project is to experiment with and learn about the World Wide Web as a museum-based communication medium. Users will be active participants in determining the content and nature of their experience in Revealing Things. At the most fundamental level, users will be the designers of their personal exhibits as they decide how to navigate through the material and participate in mission-oriented use of the site. Revealing Things will also offer opportunities for users to leave their mark on the program, contributing objects and stories to the presentation. Most important, material in Revealing Things will change constantly. The choice of topics and themes will change often and unpredictably. Assembling data on the fly will allow many pages in the Web site to personalize the information. Users will interact with the program and provide information that will change the experience for themselves and others."

    "abstract": "Although the intent of media as a tool to educate the public is sometimes realized, just as often mass media is driven more by market forces than by accurate presentation of information. Recently, NBC broadcast \"Mysterious Origins,\" narrated by Charleton Heston, which blatantly presented false information regarding evolution and human origins. The show was recently rebroadcast, because controversy is more important than accuracy when it comes to moneymaking. New media like the Internet promise to be driven less by commercial interests and have many advantages over television, radio or newspaper. One of the greatest potentials of the Internet, still mostly unfulfilled, is to bridge the gap between research and education in the sciences. Currently, research is disseminated broadly in only a few major journals like Science and Nature. Most research is of special interest only to other researchers. Although the Internet can provide a means to allow communication between researchers, more importantly it can allow access to and contextualization of material in a broader context. If research is properly handled on the Internet, I believe that institutions can make their products more valuable to society. I will discuss the notion of hierarchy of information in a laterally directed medium like the Web and present examples of bridging the gap between research and education taken from my work on the University of California Museum of Paleontology Web site."

    "abstract": "The museum is a perspicuous site for analyzing the complex interplay between social, organizational, cultural, and political factors which have relevance to the design and use of \\\"virtual\\\" technology. Specifically, the introduction of virtual technologies in museums runs up against the issue of the situated character of information use. Across a number of disciplines (anthropology, sociology, psychology, cognitive science) there is growing recognition of the `situatedness\\' of knowledge and its importance for the design and use of technology. This awareness is fostered by the fact that technological developments are often associated with disappointing gains for users. The effective use of technology relies on the degree to which it can be embedded in or made congruent with the `local\\' practices of people who are working with it. This paper argues that the value of virtual technologies in museums depends upon the extent to which the design of such technologies takes account of t! he ordinary practices of museum users. Drawing upon field research in two museums of science and technology, both of which are in the process of introducing virtual technologies and exploring the possibilities of on-line access, findings are presented which suggest that the success of such developments will depend on the extent to which they are informed by detailed understanding of practice, both among museum visitors and curatorial and educational professionals."

    "author": "Janet Hitzeman, Jon Oberlander",
    "url": null,
    "year": "1997",
    "abstract": "The first phase of the Intelligent Labelling Explorer project has built the ILEX-1 system, which uses Natural Language technology to generate descriptions of objects displayed in a museum gallery. Each description appears on a Web page, and the user can move from page to page, viewing the objects in any order, mimicking the experience of someone walking through the museum. Crucially, these descriptions aren't simply retrieved from a storage space, but are generated on demand by combining canned text with fully generated text in a coherent way. This use of \"dynamic hypertext\" allows ILEX-1 to generate descriptions appropriate to the expertise level of the user and, for instance, to refer back to objects the user has already seen or to suggest objects the user might be interested in based on what objects they've chosen to look at so far. For example, ILEX-1 can refer to previously seen objects as in \"Like the brooch you just saw, these earrings were designed by Jesse M. King or \"Other jewels in the Bohemian style include a necklace designed for Liberty & Co. and a ring made out of glass.\" To date, two versions have been implemented (ILEX-0 and ILEX-1); both describe objects in the National Museums of Scotland's 20th Century Jewelry Gallery. One of the central concerns of ILEX-1 is to ensure that the descriptions generated are coherent, and this paper will describe the module for choosing the appropriate noun phrase to use at a particular place in the text. This module takes into account the user's familiarity with the objects described based on expertise level and user history, and must take into account linguistic information such as the structure of the text."

    "abstract": "In the final scene of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", a crate containing the object of Indiana Jones' quest is wheeled into an immense warehouse for indefinite storage and questionable research access. Unfortunately, this fate is not all that far from reality. Collections of archaeological and ethnographic materials ranging from stone axes, broken potsherds, and carved monuments to baskets, ceremonial masks, and skin canoes have been held by museums collections since the Renaissance. However, their inestimable value and unique conservation and curatorial requirements often conspire to remove them from the reach of all but the most diligent scholars. The potential of the Web to enhance the quality of research on archaeological and ethnographic collections is enormous. This paper will examine ways that one can use the Web to enhance research and improve access to a variety of materials. It will also explore the potential of the Web for innovative research strategies. Digitization of catalogs, associated documents, and images to help one locate and study collections and specific artifacts are just one approach. Others include the connection of devices to the Web, such as cameras and microscopes, the creation of virtual reference collections, and the establishment of research networks that will enhance the identification and analysis of material culture. This paper will also consider the role the Web will play in issues of cultural property, contributing to and in many ways intensifying ongoing debates of ownership, curation, conservation, and repatriation of sensitive materials."

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental bases for the operation of the Internet is the Domain Name System (DNS). This is a rigorously structured distributed database system that is used to translate such things as the names of Web sites into the numerical addresses used to establish communication with host computers. The number of top level domains (.COM, .ORG, .UK, etc) contained in the DNS is in the process of being expanded. This may result in the museum community being able to establish a greater degree of sectorial identity than it currently has. A domain designation has obvious potential for providing an easily remembered means for locating an organization\\'s network resources. Unfortunately, the demand for attractive domain names far exceeds the supply. One of the reasons for the current DNS revision is to provide some relief from this difficulty. If the museum community wishes to take advantage of this potential it needs to articulate its needs clearly and take corresponding action. This presentation is intented to discuss possible approaches towards this end. It will be introduced by a description of the basic workings of the DNS and the domain registration process. Particular attention will be paid to international initiatives designed to enhance the heritage sector\\'s prominence both in the DNS and in other registries of network resources."

From the beginning, it was felt that a \"Build it, they will come\" approach would not meet these ambitious needs. For the project to succeed, there needed to be active involvement of faculty in the design and use of Utopia. The author will detail the involvement of faculty in the design of the Utopia project, the changes that have been made or are anticipated in response to their requests, and how the faculty have then tried to incorporate Utopia into courses at Cornell. Faculty involvement is only part of the process of developing a user-centered system design, however. Input from students is also needed. This fall the Utopia database was incorporated into a large general undergraduate survey course. This paper will present as well the findings of a recent survey of students in the course and discuss the implications of the results of the survey for Web-based cultural heritage projects that hope to appeal to undergraduates."

    "abstract": "Producing a computer-based multimedia museum exhibit involves a unique set of problems in the design of a software system to satisfy the needs of a wide range of visitors and researchers. When it comes to moving the exhibit onto the Internet, new problems and issues arise. The paper introduces TAMH (Tayside: A Maritime History), a PC-based multimedia project exploring some issues involved in allowing users to ask the questions which interest them in the way they find most appropriate. The process discussed is that of moving the TAMH system from its original standalone or locally networked form to a Web-based virtual museum site, allowing universal access to a multimedia database archive, and novel methods of searching the archive. The standalone TAMH system uses interactive maps and visual criteria selection to search the database, as well as more traditional field searching methods, allowing a whole spectrum of users to traverse the database and discover facts and connections. The original design concept was to move away from rigid hypertext-like links. Emulating this flexibility in the on-line version involves careful design of the Web-based system. Indeed, the fact that the underlying st ructure is a database will be of interest to only a small proportion of users. To the rest, to maintain their interest, this fact needs to be disguised. In addition, the Internet environment provides new facilities which can be used in the evolution of the exhibit, and a perfect medium for collecting feedback on system and content design from a large body of visitors."

    "abstract": "In real life, an art museum landscapes around a building design concept with a defined exterior and adjustable interior spaces with a permanent collection and curated exhibitions. Implementing an art museum on the Web can either simulate or represent its real world environment or it can be completely built upon a virtual space. Currently, with exceptions, many real world art museums are represented by a 2D design concept filled with icons and its associated links together with snippets of collections. The prime objective of such a digital brochure is simply offering a vehicle to inform visitors of its physical presence. Using current available technological tools, this paper distinguishes the difference between the Web representation of a real world museum and a Web museum. Based on the author's extensive Web site visualization, design and implementation experiences, this paper examines and presents an art museum design philosophy and concepts. It details design elements in appropriating and apportioning multimedia contents (e.g. exhibits, art critic essays) selection in the extent of text annotation, image size, quality and quantity as well as the inclusion of audio sound bytes, music and video clips. As such, it suggests and offers the determinants for the basis and demand of creating animation (e.g. Gif89a, Shockwaves, JavaScript, Java Applets) for both 3D and 2D Web Sites. As it offers an array of a Web Page layout format, it offers an insight into the Site's navigational psychology and pattern with strong emphasis on aesthetics interests, Site ambiance versus systems performance considerations. It provides and reviews the choice of Site architecture with or without business transaction-oriented capabilities and problems concerning security issues and measures. Beyond which, it offers tools and methodologies for links validation and Site implementation guide. Ultimately, this paper is concerned with the ways to build a Web Site that excites -- one that is content rich and punctuated with fun elements with the possibility of setting up an art museum Intranet with archiving, inventory control and visitor profile databases."

However, one large section of the general population has been hardly affected by this revolution. Currently there are no established means by which young children, ages 2-5 can access the relevant parts of this vast collection. The major problem is the lack of a child-friendly interface environment which would allow children to interact in a meaningful way with a digitally presented information. Although the problem was commonly recognized during the past decade it was not considered acute until the recent explosion of information availability. Using the model of an existing child-friendly interface environment (KiddyFace, Milekic 1996), I argue in this paper for the necessity of creation of a specific milieu which will make the information accessible in an age appropriate manner."

    "abstract": "The emphasis given to information acquisition and dissemination for cultural organizations is clearly reflected in some recent important public statements, including that of the June 1991 document adopted by 34 governments issued by the Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Greater emphasis was given to this subject at the last meeting of the G7 nations in Brussels, where it was specified that \"culture is a key dimension of the Information Society.\" In most European countries, long-term efforts have been undertaken to preserve, describe and index cultural heritage. More recently, many public authorities and private entities have begun digitizing important parts of this heritage. Over the past several years, public sector cultural organizations have put a greater emphasis on knowledge dissemination to different types of user communities - both domestic and foreign. As a consequence, increased importance has been directed to satisfying the needs of different user \"publics.\" Such efforts are leading to the development of market segmentation -- involving distinguishing different user subgroups, where each is characterized by an homogenous set of needs. This approach results in the development of different types of services to address the needs of different targeted user populations. In this context, interactive multimedia technologies enable cultural organizations to implement strategies of content dissemination which takes into account the alternative ways information can be structured and communicated to different publics. This paper will examine how strategies for multimedia cultural heritage infrastructures and products are being formulated in France and the policies that are being adopted."

At the Illinois State Museum, we have been using QTVR technology to provide educational opportunities using collections and to enhance ongoing research efforts. Perhaps the most exciting use to which the ISM has put QTVR is as a component of the Museums in the Classroom project. Museums in the Classroom is an initiative of the Illinois State Board of Education under which museums, including the Illinois State Museum work closely with K-12 teachers and students throughout the state of Illinois to guide the classes in creating online and off-line projects on topics of interest to the museums and classes. In this project, the Illinois State Museum is working with the Brookfield Zoo and 25 schools on projects featuring natural and cultural diversity. An important component of this inte! raction is allowing students to come to the museum and to help them create QTVR objects of pieces from the museum collections which pertain to their research. The students then incorporate these objects into their WWW exhibits. Another important potential use of QTVR at the ISM involves communication with scholars who would like to borrow items from the collections for study. QTVR objects can be created of fragile items and researchers can view these via the Internet before determining whether they are needed. This may prevent shipping an item to a researcher only to have them find that the crucial portion of the specimen is not visible."

Most significant has been the provision of images of entire collections, including thousands of works for which no photographs were previously available even in the files of the museums. Yet, understandably, most of these images have been put on at low resolutions that are useful for little more than identification. Details cannot be seen or visual effects perceived, much less inscriptions read or brush strokes distinguished, and the relation of the digital image to the original object is rarely specified. The fact that digital projects can be prohibitively expensive, the need for expanded band-width and massive storage, and the still unresolved questions regarding copyright and fair use do not alter the fact that for research in art history and related disciplines, scholars, teachers and students must be able to explore images in detail and with confidence in the types of the evidence they provide and those they don't. As a demonstration of what is needed for research in disciplines that depend on images as evidence, I will show examples of digital image assignments tested over the past two years in art history classes at Reed College. The attempt has been to make available to students digital images that can be studied in a process of in-depth exploration parallel to that of art historians when conducting first-hand research on works of art."

    "abstract": "This talk will discuss an exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution, exploring recent trends in graphic imagery (through Feb 17, 1997). The website accompanying the exhibition includes a compendium of 18 home pages chosen from various illustrators and designers as well as a series of highly interactive areas where viewers are invited to send \"Webograms\", design their own corporate logos, or post a message in the \"Fog\" room. Web designer Elisabeth Roxby and curator Ellen Lupton discuss the potential of web design as an emerging artform and the process of \"virtual collecting\"."

    "abstract": "Managing and maintaining a Web presence becomes non-trivial when the size of the service exceeds a certain limit. Keeping the data organization, the information mapping to Web pages, and the navigation design manageable, while providing a consistent interface in terms of layout and usability, are basic requirements to Web presence. Currently the tools for managing and maintaining Web presence are limited as most page editors work on small sets of pages. During the work on the Vienna International Festival web presence of 300 multilingual pages we soon stepped beyond manageability with common page editors. We developed a methodology to organize, implement, and maintain a web presence. The methodology includes scientific design and organization modeling, integration of static and interactive WWW services, and consistent layout management using editable WWW interface templates. An object-oriented language is used to describe data organization, layout templates, and presence contents in a manageable and maintainable way."

    "author": "Janice Sorkow",

    "year": "1997",
    "abstract": "Museums have dealt with the publication of images of their objects in print publications for nearly a century, by using fairly clear cut policies, regulations, and prices. The use of digital images of Museum objects on the Web in the past few years, has taken the museum business by complete surprise. This paper will examine the issues museums must consider when providing images and permissions for Web-based publications. It will also propose practical guidelines for image licensing in this medium. Definitions of types of Web publications, strategies for pricing based on models from the commercial world, methods for order fulfillment, and contract terms will be outlined. Also included will be a discussion about licensing images for the Web differs from CD licensing, as well as an analysis of the present and future administrative, financial, and mission-based implications that the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston is facing as an image provider."

The reality is a return to the bad old days of proprietary hardwired solutions. Appreciating what SGML brings to the table requires an understanding both of its origins and of its characteristics. SMGL is not what is appears to be at first glance. In this paper, we look at: where SGML came from how a business case ca (or cannot) be made for SGML what alternatives exist today attempts to \"fix\" SGML to make it address today's problesm how SGML can be rescued from obscurity by redevining its role."

    "abstract": "In most existing art museum web pages, the values of the museum dominate the values of the Web. Therefore, museum web pages often electronically duplicate familiar museum products-- floor plans, collection catalogues, event calendars-- rather than transforming the idea of the museum by adapting the values of the web. This presentation will seek to show how art museums and technologists can come to understand each other and use their differences productively by: Orienting museum web sites towards projects that can only be done on the web and not on paper. Using the web to overcome the many limitations to understanding imposed by the physical art museum. Using the interactive potentials of the web to change the one-way flow of information from art museum to visitor to a two-way flow which also moves from visitor to museum. Infusing the orientation towards constant change into the art museum so that the web helps the art museum to reinvent itself."

    "abstract": "The Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) has recently launched two Web-based products -- the Guide to Canadian Museums and Galleries, and the Heritage Forum. This paper will examine the issues in developing these products, the challenges that have been met and that remain, and ways in which individual institutions might apply the CHIN experience to their own situations. Issues and challenges include: creating partnerships, analysis of partners' resources and capabilities establishing mechanisms for efficient and effective online data contribution, including authentication of data through the use of user IDs and passwords analysis of audience needs highlighting contributors proving benefits and demonstrating success through mechanisms for tracking site visits and feedback encouraging commitment and ongoing contributions promoting the products within the organizations and to the larger community minimizing costs through the creation of resources that can be re-packaged and re-used."

    "year": "1997",
    "abstract": "Museums have often been understood in both intellectual and popular circles as mausoleums, as centers of accumulation of objects which no longer have a living relationship with the present. This is an image which makes it almost impossible to associate the museum with debates about contemporary cultural issues. In this paper I want to propose that this is no longer a valid way of representing the museum, largely because the museum is now deeply implicated in electronic media flows making it an important site for the newly emerging 'information society'. This new relationship between electronic technologies and museums has fundamentally questioned the traditional museum's orientation to objects, an orientation which, I argue, led to the image of museums as mausoleums in the first place. As a result the metaphors we associate with museums are beginning to change, away from the idea of the museum as disconnected from the social world towards the opposite -- the museum as a site of cultural, technological and social convergences. This involves a re-evaluation of the role of objects in museums as well as that of the curator and museum's relationships to communities."

    "year": "1997",
    "abstract": "Within the context of higher education students are able to gain access to a growing archive information for their studies in art and design history and practice. However, the educational aim in using these digital resources is to encourage a \"critical\" understanding of data and its context. The aim of this paper will be to look at online and associated stand-alone projects that encourage students to be curators and authors with critical distance, rather than passive observers of endless digital spectacle. There is also a theoretical dimension to such a task. I will therefore refer to the ways in which critical theory has been used to influence and shape the development of software in a project called the Virtual Curator at the University of Brighton, (UK); ways in which an understanding of the transient nature of the digital image is crucial for an understanding of the virtual museum; and, most importantly, how giving power to the user as the creator of an archive, also re-interprets the concept of the museum itself."
